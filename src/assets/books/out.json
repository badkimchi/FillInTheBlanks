"No, no; it .

" The nuptial.
 were all celebrated that day, a.
 the emperor had re.
olved, but in a different manner.
 The younge.

 were .
olemnized with all the rejoicing.
 u.
ual at the marriage.
 of the emperor.
 of Per.
ia; and tho.
e of the other two .

 according to the quality and di.
tinction of their hu.
band.
; the one a.
 the .
ultan'.
 chief baker, and the other a.
 head cook.
.
n.
nThe two elder felt .
trongly the di.
proportion of their marriage.
 to that of their younger .
i.
ter.
 Thi.
 con.
ideration made them far from being content, though they were arrived at the utmo.
t height of their late wi.
he.
, and much beyond their hope.
.
 They gave them.
elve.
 up to an exce.
.
 of jealou.
y, which not only di.
turbed their joy, but wa.
 the cau.
e of great trouble and affliction to the queen-con.
ort, their younger .
i.
ter.
 They had not an opportunity to communicate their thought.
 to each other on the preference the emperor had given her, but were altogether employed in preparing them.
elve.
 for the celebration of their marriage.
.
 Some day.
 afterward, when they had an opportunity of .
eeing each other at the public bath.
, the elde.
t .
aid to the other: .
"Well, what .
ay you to our .
i.
ter'.
 great fortune? I.
 not .
he a fine per.
on to be a queen!.
" .
"I mu.
t own,.
" .
aid the other .
i.
ter, .
"I cannot conceive what charm.
 the emperor could di.
cover to be .
o bewitched by her.
 Wa.
 it a rea.
on .
ufficient for him not to ca.
t hi.
 eye.
 on you, becau.
e .
he wa.
 .
omewhat younger? You were a.
 worthy of hi.
 throne, and in ju.
tice he ought to have preferred you.
.
".
n.
n.
"Si.
ter,.
" .
aid the elder, .
"I .
hould not have regretted if hi.
 maje.
ty had but pitched upon you; but that he .
hould choo.
e that little .
impleton really grieve.
 me.
 But I will revenge my.
elf; and you, I think, are a.
 much concerned a.
 I; therefore, I propo.
e that we .
hould contrive mea.
ure.
 and act in concert: communicate to me what you think the likelie.
t way to mortify her, while I, on my .
ide, will inform you what my de.
ire of revenge .
hall .
ugge.
t to me.
.
" After thi.
 wicked agreement, the two .
i.
ter.
 .
aw each other frequently, and con.
ulted how they might di.
turb and interrupt the happine.
.
 of the queen.
 They propo.
ed a great many way.
, but in deliberating about the manner of executing them, found .
o many difficultie.
 that they dur.
t not attempt them.
 In the meantime, with a dete.
table di.
.
imulation, they often went together to make her vi.
it.
, and every time .
howed her all the mark.
 of affection they could devi.
e, to per.
uade her how overjoyed they were to have a .
i.
ter rai.
ed to .
o high a fortune.
 The queen, on her part, con.
tantly received them with all the demon.
tration.
 of e.
teem they could expect from .
o near a relative.
 Some time after her marriage, the expected birth of an heir gave great joy to the queen and emperor, which wa.
 communicated to all the court, and .
pread throughout the empire.
 Upon thi.
 new.
 the two .
i.
ter.
 came to pay their compliment.
, and proffered their .
ervice.
, de.
iring her, if not provided with nur.
e.
, to accept of them.
.
n.
nThe queen .
aid to them mo.
t obligingly: .
"Si.
ter.
, I .
hould de.
ire nothing more, if it were in my power to make the choice.
 I am, however, obliged to you for your goodwill, but mu.
t .
ubmit to what the emperor .
hall order on thi.
 occa.
ion.
 Let your hu.
band.
 employ their friend.
 to make intere.
t, and get .
ome courtier to a.

ty, and if he .
peak.
 to me about it, be a.
.
ured that I .
hall not only expre.
.
 the plea.
ure he doe.
 me but thank him for making choice of you.
.
".
n.
nThe two hu.
band.
 applied them.
elve.
 to .
ome courtier.
, their patron.
, and begged of them to u.
e their intere.
t to procure their wive.
 the honour they a.
pired to.
 Tho.
e patron.
 exerted them.
elve.
 .
o much in their behalf that the emperor promi.
ed them to con.
ider of the matter, and wa.
 a.
 good a.
 hi.
 word; for in conver.
ation with the queen he told her that he thought her .
i.
ter.
 were the mo.
t proper per.
on.
 to be about her, but would not name them before he had a.
ked her con.
ent.
 The queen, .
en.
ible of the deference the emperor .
o obligingly paid her, .
aid to him, .
"Sir, I wa.
 prepared to do a.
 your maje.
ty might plea.
e to command.
 But .
ince you have been .
o kind a.
 to think of my .

ter.
, I thank you for the regard you have .
hown them for my .
ake, and therefore I .
hall not di.
.
emble that I had rather have them than .
tranger.
.
.
" The emperor therefore named the queen'.
 two .
i.
ter.
 to be her attendant.
; and from that time they went frequently to the palace, overjoyed at the opportunity they would have of executing the dete.
table wickedne.
.
 they had meditated again.
t the queen.
.
n.
nShortly afterward a young prince, a.
 bright a.
 the day, wa.
 born to the queen; but neither hi.
 innocence nor beauty could move the cruel heart.
 of the mercile.
.
 .
i.
ter.
.
 They wrapped him up carele.
.
ly in hi.
 cloth.
 and put him into a ba.
ket, which they abandoned to the .
tream of a .
mall canal that ran under the queen'.
 apartment, and declared that .
he had given birth to a puppy.
 Thi.
 dreadful intelligence wa.
 announced to the emperor, who became .
o angry at the circum.
tance, that he wa.
 likely to have occa.
ioned the queen'.
 death, if hi.
 grand vizier had not repre.
ented to him that he could not, without inju.
tice, make her an.
werable for the mi.
fortune.
.
n.
nIn the meantime, the ba.
ket in which the little prince wa.
 expo.
ed wa.
 carried by the .
tream beyond a wall which bounded the pro.
pect of the queen'.
 apartment, and from thence floated with the current down the garden.
.
 By chance the intendant of the emperor'.
 garden.
, one of the principal officer.
 of the kingdom, wa.
 walking in the garden by the .
ide of thi.
 canal, and, perceiving a ba.
ket floating, called to a gardener who wa.
 not far off, to bring it to .
hore that he might .
ee what it contained.
 The gardener, with a rake which he had in hi.
 hand, drew the ba.
ket to the .
ide of the canal, took it up, and gave it to him.
 The intendant of the garden.
 wa.
 extremely .
urpri.
ed to .
ee in the ba.
ket a child, which, though he knew it could be but ju.
t born, had very fine feature.
.
 Thi.
 officer had been married .
everal year.
, but though he had alway.
 been de.
irou.
 of having children, Heaven had never ble.
.
ed him with any.
 Thi.
 accident interrupted hi.
 walk: he made the gardener follow him with the child, and when he came to hi.
 own hou.
e, which wa.
 .
ituated at the entrance to the garden.
 of the palace, went into hi.
 wife'.
 apartment.
 .
"Wife,.
" .
aid he, .
"a.
 we have no children of our own, God ha.
 .
ent u.
 one.
 I recommend him to you; provide him a nur.

on; for, from thi.
 moment, I acknowledge him a.

" The intendant'.
 wife received the child with great joy, and took particular plea.
ure in the care of him.
 The intendant him.
elf would not inquire too narrowly whence the infant came.
 He .
aw plainly it came not far off from the queen'.
 apartment, but it wa.
 not hi.
 bu.
ine.
.
 to examine too clo.
ely into what had pa.

ed, nor to create di.
turbance.
 in a place where peace wa.
 .
o nece.

n.
nThe following year another prince wa.
 born, on whom the unnatural .
i.
ter.
 had no more compa.

ion than on hi.
 brother, but expo.
ed him likewi.
e in a ba.
ket and .
et him adrift in the canal, pretending, thi.
 time, that the .
ultana had given birth to a cat.
 It wa.
 happy al.
o for thi.
 child that the intendant of the garden.
 wa.
 walking by the canal .
ide, for he had it carried to hi.
 wife, and charged her to take a.
 much care of it a.
 of the former, which wa.
 a.
 agreeable to her inclination a.
 it wa.
 to hi.
 own.
.
n.
nThe emperor of Per.
ia wa.
 more enraged thi.
 time again.
t the queen than before, and .
he had felt the effect.
 of hi.
 anger if the grand vizier'.
 remon.
trance.
 had not prevailed.
 The third year the queen gave birth to a prince.

 He pronounced .

 A.

 When they perceived, by the number of hor.

olved to di.
continue their cha.

 In their .

 to look at him.
 The emperor, who .

 A.
 he drew them toward the .

tead of fi.
h hi.

.
 of an a.

 much vexed.
.
n.
nWhen he had mended hi.

, which the carca.
.
 of the a.
.
 had broken in .
everal place.
, he threw them in a .
econd time; and when he drew them, found a great deal of re.
i.
tance, which made him think he had taken abundance of fi.
h; but he found nothing except a ba.
ket full of gravel and .
lime, which grieved him extremely.
 .
"O Fortune!.
" cried he, with a lamentable tone, .
"be not angry with me, nor per.
ecute a wretch who pray.
 thee to .

 They had a plea.

n.
nTHE STORY OF GULNARE OF THE SEA.
nThere wa.
, in olden time, and in an ancient age and period, in the land of the Per.
ian.
, a king named Shahzeman, and the place of hi.
 re.
idence wa.
 Khora.
.
an.
 He had not been ble.
t, during hi.
 whole life, with a male child nor a female; and he reflected upon thi.
, one day, and lamented that the greater portion of hi.
 life had pa.
.
ed, and he had no heir to take the kingdom after him a.
 he had inherited it from hi.
 father.
 and forefather.
.
 So the utmo.
t grief befell him on thi.
 account.
.
n.
nNow while he wa.
 .
itting one day, one of hi.
 mameluke.
 came in to him, and .
aid to him: .
"O my lord, at the door i.
 a .
lave-girl with a merchant: none more beautiful than .
he hath been .
een.
.
" And he replied: .
"Bring to me the merchant and the .
lave-girl.
.
" The merchant and the .
lave-girl therefore came to him; and when he .
aw her, he found her to re.
emble the lance in .
traightne.
.
 and .
lenderne.
.
.
 She wa.
 wrapped in a garment of .
ilk embroidered with gold, and the merchant uncovered her face, whereupon the place wa.
 illuminated by her beauty, and there hung down from her forehead .
even lock.
 of hair reaching to her anklet.
.
 The King, therefore, wondered at the .
ight of her, and at her beauty, and her .
tature and ju.
tne.
.
 of form; and he .
aid to the merchant: .
"O .
heikh, for how much i.
 thi.
 dam.
el to be .
old?.
" The merchant an.
wered: .
"O my lord, I purcha.
ed her for two thou.
and piece.
 of gold of the merchant who owned her before me, and I have been for three year.
 travelling with her, and .
he hath co.
t, to the period of her arrival at thi.
 place, three thou.
and piece.
 of gold; and .
he i.
 a pre.
ent from me unto thee.
.
" Upon thi.
, the king conferred upon him a magnificent robe of honour, and gave order.
 to pre.
ent him with ten thou.
and piece.
 of gold.
 So he took them, and ki.
.
ed the hand.
 of the king, thanking him for hi.
 beneficence, and departed.
 Then the king committed the dam.
el to the tirewomen, .
aying to them: .
"Amend the .
tate of thi.
 dam.
el, and deck her, and furni.
h for her a private chamber, and take her into it.
.
" He al.
o gave order.
 to hi.
 chamberlain.
 that everything which .
he required .
hould be conveyed to her.
 The .
eat of government where he re.
ided wa.
 on the .
hore of the .
ea, and hi.
 city wa.
 called the White City.
 And they conducted the dam.
el into a private chamber, which chamber had window.
 overlooking the .
ea; and the king commanded hi.
 chamberlain.
 to clo.
e all the door.
 upon her after taking to her all that .
he required.
.
n.
nThe king then went in to vi.
it the dam.
el; but .
he ro.
e not to him, nor took any notice of him.
 So the king .
aid: .
"It .
eemeth that .
he hath been with people who have not taught her good manner.
.
.
" And looking at the dam.
el, he .
aw her to be a per.
on .
urpa.
.
ing in loveline.
.
, her face wa.
 like the di.
k of the moon at the full, or the .
hining .
un in the clear .
ky; and he wondered at her beauty, extolling the perfection of God, the Creator: then the king advanced to the dam.
el, and .
eated him.
elf by her .
ide, pre.
.
ed her to hi.
 bo.
om, and ki.
.
ed her lip.
, which he found to be .
weeter than honey.
 After thi.
, he gave order.
 to bring table.
 of the riche.
t viand.
, compri.
ing di.
he.
 of every kind; and he ate, and put mor.
el.
 into her mouth until .
he wa.
 .
ati.
fied; but .
he .
poke not a .
ingle word.
 The king talked to her, and inquired of her her name; but .
he wa.
 .
ilent, not uttering a word, nor returning him an an.
wer, cea.
ing not to hang down her head toward the ground; and what protected her from the anger of the king wa.
 her beauty, and her tenderne.
.
 of manner.
 So the king .
aid within him.
elf: .
"Extolled be the perfection of God, the Creator of thi.
 dam.
el! How elegant i.
 .
he, .
aving that .
he doth not .
peak!.
"—Then the king a.
ked the female .
lave.
 whether .
he had .
poken; and they an.
wered him: .
"From the time of her arrival to the pre.
ent moment .
he hath not .
poken one word, and we have not heard her talk.
.
" The king therefore cau.
ed .
ome of them to come, and .
ing to her, and make merry with her, thinking that then .
he might perhap.
 .
peak.
 Accordingly the female .
lave.
 played before her with all kind.
 of mu.
ical in.
trument.
, and enacted .
port.
 and other performance.
, and they .
ang .
o that every one who wa.
 pre.
ent wa.
 moved with delight, except the dam.
el, who looked at them and wa.
 .
ilent, neither laughing nor .
peaking.
 So the heart of the king wa.
 contracted.
 He however inclined to her entirely, paying no regard to other.
, but relinqui.
hing all the re.
t of hi.
 favourite.
.
.
n.
nHe remained with her a whole year, which .
eemed a.
 one day, and .
till .
he .
poke not; and he .
aid to her one day, when hi.
 pa.
.
ion wa.
 exce.
.
ive: .
"O de.
ire of .
oul.
, verily the love that I have for thee i.
 great, and I have relinqui.
hed for thy .
ake all my worldly portion, and been patient with thee a whole year.
 I beg God that He will, in Hi.
 grace, .
often thy heart toward me, and that thou maye.
t .
peak to me.
 Or, if thou be dumb, inform me by a .
ign, that I may give up hope of thy .
peaking.
 I al.
o beg of God that He will ble.
.
 thee with a .
on that may inherit my kingdom after me; for I am .
olitary, having none to be my heir, and my age hath become great.
 I conjure thee, then, by Allah, if thou love me, that thou return me a reply.
.
" And upon thi.
, the dam.
el hung her head toward the ground, meditating.
 Then .
he rai.
ed her head, and .
miled in the face of the king, whereat it appeared to the king that lightning filled the private chamber; and .
he .
aid: .
"O magnanimou.
 King, God hath an.
wered thy prayer; for I am about to bring thee a child, and the time i.
 almo.
t come.
 And were it not that I knew thi.
 thing, I had not .
poken to thee one word.
.
" And when the king heard what .
he .
aid, hi.
 face brightened up with happine.
.
, and he ki.
.
ed her hand.
 by rea.
on of the violence of hi.
 joy, and .
aid: .
"Prai.
e be to God who hath favoured me with thing.
 that I de.
ired; the fir.
t, thy .
peaking; and the .
econd, thy information that thou art about to bring me a child.
.
" Then the king aro.
e and went forth from her, and .
eated him.
elf upon the throne of hi.
 kingdom in a .
tate of exceeding happine.
.
; and he ordered the vizier to give out to the poor and the needy a hundred thou.
and piece.
 of gold a.
 a thank-offering to God.
 So the vizier did a.
 the king had commanded him.
 And after that, the king went in to the dam.
el, and embraced her, .
aying to her: .
"O my mi.
tre.
.
, wherefore hath been thi.
 .
ilence, .
eeing that thou ha.
t been with me a whole year, awake and a.
leep, yet ha.
t not .
poken to me, except on thi.
 day?.
".
n.
nThe dam.
el an.
wered: .
"Hear, O King of the age, and know that I am a poor per.
on, a .
tranger, broken-hearted: I have become .
eparated from my mother, and my family, and my brother.
.
" And when the king heard her word.
, he knew her de.
ire, and he replied: .
"A.
 to thy .
aying that thou art poor, there i.
 no occa.
ion for .
uch an a.
.
ertion; for all my kingdom and po.

 are at thy .
ervice, and a.
 to thy .
aying, 'I have become .
eparated from my mother and my family and my brother'—inform me in what place they are, and I will .
end to them, and bring them to thee.
.
" So .
he .
aid to him: .
"Know, O King, that my name i.
 Gulnare (Pomegranate Flower) of the Sea.
 My father wa.
 one of the King.
 of the Sea, and he died, and left to u.
 the kingdom; but while we were enjoying it, another of the king.
 came upon u.
, and took the kingdom from our hand.
.
 I have al.
o a brother named Saleh, and my mother i.
 of the women of the .
ea; and I quarrelled with my brother, and .
wore that I would throw my.
elf into the hand.

 Accordingly I came forth from the .

 But had not thy heart loved me, and had.

hould have ca.

 I wa.

 How then .

" She an.

" So when the king heard the word.
 of her brother, hi.
 rea.
on fled in con.
equence of hi.
 fear le.
t the dam.
el .
hould accept the propo.
al of her kindred, and he could not prevent her, though he wa.
 inflamed with love of her; wherefore he became perplexed in violent fear of her .
eparation.
 But a.
 to the dam.
el Gulnare, on hearing the word.
 of her brother .
he .
aid: .
"By Allah, O my brother, the man who purcha.
ed me i.
 the king of thi.
 city, and he i.
 a great king, and a man of wi.
dom, generou.
, of the utmo.
t liberality.
 He hath treated me with honour, and he i.
 a per.
on of kindne.
.
, and of great wealth, but hath no male child nor a female.
 He hath .
hewn me favour too, and acted well to me in every re.
pect; and from the day when I came to him to the pre.
ent time, I have not heard from him a word to grieve my heart; but he hath not cea.
ed to treat me with courte.
y, and I am living with him in the mo.
t perfect of enjoyment.
.
 Moreover, if I quitted him, he would peri.
h: for he can never endure my .
eparation even for a .
ingle hour.
 I al.
o, if I quitted him, .
hould die of my love for him in con.
equence of hi.
 kindne.
.
 to me during the period of my re.
idence with him; for if my father were living, my condition with him would not be like my condition with thi.
 great, gloriou.
 king.
 God (who.
e name be exalted!) afflicted me not, but compen.
ated me well; and a.
 the king hath not a male child nor a female, I beg God to ble.
.

on that may inherit of thi.
 great king the.
e palace.
 and po.

.
.
" And when her brother, and the daughter.
 of her uncle, heard her word.
, their eye.
 became cheerful thereat, and they .
aid to her: .
"O Gulnare, thou art acquainted with our affection for thee, and thou art a.
.
ured that thou art the deare.
t of all per.

 to u.
, and art certain that we de.
ire for thee comfort, without trouble or toil.
 Therefore if thou be not in a .

"By Allah, I am in a .
tate of the utmo.

.
.
.
" So when the king heard the.
e word.
 from her, he rejoiced, and he thanked her for them; hi.
 love for her penetrated to hi.
 heart'.
 core, and he knew that .
he loved him a.
 he loved her, and that .
he de.
ired to remain with him to .
ee hi.
 child which .
he wa.

.
n.
nThen the dam.

 to the female .
lave.
 to bring forward viand.
 of all kind.
; and Gulnare her.
elf wa.
 the per.
on who .
uperintended the preparation of the viand.
 in the kitchen.
 So the female .
lave.
 brought to them the viand.
, and the .
weetmeat.
, and the fruit.
; and .
he ate with her family.
 But afterward they .
aid to her: .
"O Gulnare, thy ma.

.
 So when the king beheld thi.

 Then Gulnare ro.

oothed their heart.
; after which .
he walked along until .
he entered the clo.

 the king her ma.

he .
aid to him: .
"O my ma.

" The king an.

"I heard and .

"O my ma.

 For know, O King, that my brother and my mother and the daughter.
 of my uncle have conceived a great love for thee in con.

aid, 'We will not depart from thee to our country until we have an interview with the king, and .
alute him.

" And the king .
aid to her: .
"I hear and obey; for thi.
 i.
 what I de.

.
" He then ro.

aluted them with the be.

tened to ri.

at with them in the pavilion, ate with them at the table, and remained with them for a period of thirty day.
.
 Then they de.
ired to return to their country and abode.
 So they took leave of the king and Queen Gulnare of the Sea, and departed from them, after the king had treated them with the utmo.
t honour.
.
n.
nAfter thi.
, Gulnare gave birth to a boy, re.
embling the moon at the full, whereat the king experienced the utmo.

.
, becau.
e he had not before been ble.

 life.
 They continued the rejoicing.
, and the decoration of the city, for a period of .
even day.
, in the utmo.
t happine.
.
 and enjoyment; and on the .
eventh day, the mother of Gulnare, and her brother, and the daughter.
 of her uncle, all came, when they knew that .
he had given birth to her child.
 The king met them, rejoicing at their arrival, and .
aid to them: .
"I .
aid that I would not name my .
on until ye .
hould come, and that ye .
hould name him according to your knowledge.
.
" And they named him Bedr Ba.
im (Smiling Full Moon), all of them agreeing a.
 to thi.
 name.
 They then pre.
ented the boy to hi.
 maternal uncle, Saleh, who took him upon hi.
 hand.
, and, ri.
ing with him from among them, walked about the palace to the right and left; after which he went forth with him from the palace, de.
cended with him to the .
ea, and walked on until he became concealed from the eye of the king.
 So when the king .
aw that he had taken hi.
 .
on, and di.
appeared from him at the bottom of the .
ea, he de.
paired of him, and began to weep and wail.
 But Gulnare, .
eeing him in thi.

tate, .
aid to him, .
"O King of the age, fear not nor grieve for thy .

 If my brother knew that any injury would betide the little one, he had not done what he hath done; and pre.

" And but a .

" So he replied: .
"Ye.

.
" And Saleh .
aid to him: .
"O King of the Land, we applied to hi.

 And he .

 So when we .

"By Allah, one of the.

" Then the king thanked Saleh of the Sea for hi.

"I am aba.

" So Gulnare thanked her brother for that which he had done; but her brother .

"O King of the age, to thank thee hath been incumbent on u.
; for thou ha.

"If we .

" And Saleh remained with the king, he and hi.

 Then they .

 There wa.
 not one of the children of the inhabitant.
 of the city, men and women, that talked not of the charm.
 of that young man; for he wa.
 of .
urpa.

 Then the king .
ummoned the vizier and the emeer.

wear by binding oath.
 that they would make Bedr Ba.

 And on the following day, the king mounted, together with the lord.

 So when hi.

covered that thi.
 lamp lay concealed in a .
ubterranean place in the mid.

ame frugality a.
 before, except that Aladdin dre.
.
ed better; a.
 for hi.

he wore no clothe.
 but what .
he earned by .
pinning cotton.
 After their manner of living, it may ea.
ily be .
uppo.
ed that the money for which Aladdin had .
old the di.

 .
ufficient to maintain them for .
ome time.
.
n.
nDuring thi.
 interval, Aladdin frequented the .
hop.
 of the principal merchant.
, where they .
old cloth of gold and .
ilver, linen.
, .
ilk .
tuff.
, and jewelry, and oftentime.
 joining in their conver.
ation, acquired a knowledge of the world, and re.
pectable demeanour.
 By hi.
 acquaintance among the jeweller.
, he came to know that the fruit.
 which he had gathered when he took the lamp were, in.
tead of coloured gla.
.
, .
tone.
 of ine.
timable value; but he had the prudence not to mention thi.
 to any one, not even to hi.
 mother.
.
n.
nOne day a.
 Aladdin wa.
 walking about the town, he heard an order proclaimed, commanding the people to .
hut up their .
hop.
 and hou.
e.
, and keep within door.
, while the Prince.
.
 Badroulboudour, the .
ultan'.
 daughter, went to the bath.
 and returned.

pired Aladdin with eager curio.

.
ion into the hou.

ome acquaintance, and then only through a window; but to gratify hi.
 curio.
ity, he pre.
ently thought of a .
cheme, which .
ucceeded; it wa.
 to place him.
elf behind the door of the bath, which wa.
 .
o .
ituated that he could not fail of .
eeing her face.
.
n.
nAladdin had not waited long before the prince.
.
 came, and he could .
ee her plainly through a chink of the door without being di.
covered.
 She wa.
 attended by a great crowd of ladie.
, .
lave.
, and eunuch.
, who walked on each .
ide, and behind her.
 When .
he came within three or four pace.
 of the door of the bath.
, .
he took off her veil, and gave Aladdin an opportunity of a full view.
.

t, he re.

 He could not .

n.

 put the grand vizier into extreme agitation.
 The .

 Badroulboudour never pa.

 Hi.

 Neither did they hear anything of the di.

 When he came there, he alighted at the .

 When he came there, he found hi.

 a.
 left the mini.
ter no room to doubt but that the fact wa.
 a.

 belief that Aladdin'.

 the effect of enchantment, a.
 he had told the .
ultan the fir.

aw it.
 He wa.
 going to repeat the ob.

 The .

 in a day to contemplate and admire it.
.
n.
nAladdin did not confine him.
elf in hi.
 palace; but took care to .
how him.
elf once or twice a week in the town, by going .
ometime.
 to one mo.
que, and .
ometime.
 to another, to prayer.
; or to vi.
it the grand vizier, who affected to pay hi.

; or to do the principal lord.
 of the court the honour to return their vi.

 after he had regaled them at hi.

 Every time he went out, he cau.

 of hi.
 genero.

 of the people; and it wa.
 common for them to .
wear by hi.

 With all the.

 he .
howed a zeal for the public good which could not be .
ufficiently applauded.
 He gave .
ufficient proof.
 of both in a revolt on the border.

 A.
 .
oon a.

 empowered, he marched with .
o much expedition, that the .
ultan heard of the defeat of the rebel.
 before he had received an account of hi.

.
n.
nAladdin had conducted him.
elf in thi.
 manner .
everal year.
, when the African magician, who unde.
ignedly had been the in.
trument of rai.
ing him to .
o high a pitch of pro.
perity, recalled him to hi.
 recollection in Africa, whither, after hi.
 expedition, he had returned.
 And though he wa.
 almo.
t per.
uaded that Aladdin mu.
t have died mi.
erably in the .
ubterranean abode where he had left him, yet he had the curio.
ity to inform him.
elf about hi.
 end with certainty; and a.
 he wa.
 a great geomancer, he took out of a cupboard a .
quare, covered box, which he u.
ed in hi.
 geomantic ob.
ervation.
.
 After he had prepared and levelled the .
and which wa.
 in it with an intention to di.
cover whether or not Aladdin had died, he ca.
t the point.
, drew the figure.
, and formed a horo.
cope, by which, when he came to examine it, he found that in.

plendidly, wa.
 in po.
.
e.
.

.
, and wa.
 much honoured and re.
pected.
.
n.
nThe magician no .
ooner under.
tood, by the rule.
 of hi.
 diabolical art, that Aladdin had arrived to thi.
 height of good fortune, than hi.
 face became inflamed with anger, and he cried out in a rage: .
"Thi.
 .
orry tailor'.
 .
on ha.
 di.
covered the .
ecret and virtue of the lamp! I believed hi.
 death to be certain; but find that he enjoy.
 the fruit of my labour and .
tudy! I will, however, prevent hi.
 enjoying it long, or peri.
h in the attempt.
.
" He wa.
 not a great while deliberating on what he .
hould do, but the next morning mounted a barb, .
et forward, and never .
topped but to refre.
h him.
elf and hi.
 hor.
e, till he arrived at the capital of China.
 He alighted, took up hi.
 lodging in a khan, and .
tayed there the remainder of the day and the night.
.
n.
nThe next day, hi.
 fir.
t object wa.
 to inquire what people .
aid of Aladdin; and, taking a walk through the town, he went to the mo.
t public and frequented place.
, where per.

 When he had drunk off hi.

 .
"From whence come you?.

" .
"Forgive my ignorance,.
" replied the African magician; .
"I arrived here but ye.

ine.
.
 which brought me hither wa.

 When he came to the palace, and had examined it on all .
ide.
, he doubted not but that Aladdin had made u.
e of the lamp to build it.
 Without attending to the inability of a poor tailor'.

on, he knew that none but the genie.
, the .

 of the lamp, could have performed .

n.
nIt wa.
 Aladdin'.
 mi.

 After he had performed the magical operation he went to the .
uperintendent of the khan, entered into conver.

 He cro.

 The principal officer.
 of the court, who had all profe.

, in.

 to avoid .

 But had they acco.

 He did not know him.

 no longer in hi.
 .
en.

, a.
 plainly appeared by hi.
 a.
king everybody he met, and at every hou.
e, if they had .
een hi.

 The.
e que.

 made the generality believe that Aladdin wa.
 mad.
 Some laughed at him, but people of .
en.
e and humanity, particularly tho.
e who had had any connection of bu.
ine.
.
 or friend.
hip with him, really pitied him.
 For three day.
 he rambled about the city in thi.
 manner, without coming to any re.
olution or eating anything but what .
ome compa.
.
ionate people forced him to take out of charity.
 At la.
t he took the road to the country; and after he had traver.
ed .

 in wild uncertainty, at the approach of night came to the bank of a river.
 There, po.
.

 de.

"Where .
hall I .
eek my palace? In what province, country, or part of the world, .

.
? I .
hall never .
ucceed; I would better free my.

uch bitter grief a.

" He wa.
 ju.
t going to throw him.
elf into the river, but, a.
 a good Mu.
.
ulman, true to hi.
 religion, he thought he .
hould not do it without fir.
t .
aying hi.

.
 Going to prepare him.

 brink, in order to perform the u.
ual ablution.
.
 The place being .
teep and .
lippery, he .
lid down, and had certainly fallen into the river, but for a little rock, which projected about two feet out of the earth.
 Happily al.
o for him, he .
till had on the ring which the African magician had put on hi.
 finger before he went down into the .
ubterranean abode to fetch the preciou.
 lamp.
 In .
lipping down the bank he rubbed the ring .
o hard by holding on the rock, that immediately the .
ame genie appeared whom he had .
een in the cave where the magician had left him.
 .
"What would.

" .
aid the genie.
 .
"I am ready to obey thee a.

n.
nAladdin, agreeably .
urpri.
ed at an apparition he .
o little expected in hi.
 pre.
ent calamity, replied; .
"Save my life, genie, a .
econd time, either by .
howing me to the place where the palace I cau.

porting it back where it fir.

"If that be the ca.

" replied Aladdin, .
"I command thee, by the power of the ring, to tran.

" The.

 were no .

 mouth than the genie tran.
ported him into Africa, to the mid.
t of a large plain, where hi.
 palace .
tood, and placing him exactly under the window of the prince.

 All thi.
 wa.
 done almo.
t in an in.
tant.
 Aladdin, notwith.
tanding the darkne.
.
 of the night, knew hi.
 palace again; but a.
 the night wa.
 far advanced and all wa.
 quiet, he retired to .
ome di.
tance, and .
at down at the foot of a large tree.
 There, full of hope.
, and reflecting on hi.
 happine.
.
, for which he wa.
 indebted to chance, he found him.
elf in a much more comfortable .
ituation than when he wa.
 arre.
ted and carried before the .
ultan, being now delivered from the immediate danger of lo.
ing hi.
 life.
 He amu.
ed him.
elf for .
ome time with the.
e agreeable thought.
; but not having .
lept for two day.
, wa.
 unable to re.

.
n.
nThe next morning, a.

oon a.

 agreeably awakened by the .
inging not only of the bird.
 which had roo.
ted in the tree under which he had pa.
.
ed the night, but al.
o of tho.
e which frequented the thick grove.
 of the palace garden.
 When he ca.

ible joy at thinking he might .
oon be ma.

 dear Prince.

 Plea.

e hope.
, he immediately aro.

ee her.
 During thi.
 expectation, he began to con.
ider with him.
elf whence the cau.
e of hi.
 mi.
fortune had proceeded; and after mature reflection, no longer doubted that it wa.
 owing to having tru.
ted the lamp out of hi.
 .
ight.
 He accu.
ed him.
elf of negligence in letting it be a moment away from him.
 But what puzzled him mo.
t wa.
, that he could not imagine who had been .
o enviou.
 of hi.
 happine.
.
.
 He would .
oon have gue.
.
ed thi.
, if he had known that both he and hi.
 palace were now in Africa, the very name of which would .
oon have made him remember the magician, hi.
 declared enemy; but the genie, the .
lave of the ring, had not made mention of the name of the country, nor had Aladdin inquired.
.
n.
nThe prince.
.
 ro.
e earlier that morning than .
he had done .
ince her tran.
portation into Africa by the magician, who.
e pre.
ence .
he wa.
 forced to .
upport once a day, becau.
e he wa.
 ma.

he had alway.
 treated him .
o har.

 A.
 .
he wa.

.
 The prince.
.
, who could not believe the joyful tiding.
, ha.
tened her.

eeing Aladdin, immediately opened it.
 The noi.

 head that way, and perceiving the prince.
.
 he .
aluted her with joy.
 .
"To lo.

n.
nWhen Aladdin wa.

ide.
, and perceiving a pea.
ant going into the country, ha.
tened after him; and when he had overtaken him, made a propo.

 When they had made the exchange, the countryman went about hi.

 The druggi.

 Aladdin put the money into hi.

nTHE STORY OF PRINCE AGIB.
nI wa.
 a king, and the .
on of a king; and when my father died, I .
ucceeded to hi.
 throne, and governed my .
ubject.
 with ju.
tice and beneficence.
 I took plea.
ure in .
ea-voyage.
; and my capital wa.
 on the .
hore of an exten.
ive .
ea, inter.
per.
ed with fortified and garri.
oned i.
land.
, which I de.
ired, for my amu.
ement, to vi.
it; I therefore embarked with a fleet of ten .
hip.
, and took with me provi.
ion.
 .
ufficient for a whole month.
 I proceeded twenty day.
, after which there aro.
e again.
t u.
 a contrary wind; but at daybreak it cea.
ed, and the .
ea became calm, and we arrived at an i.
land, where we landed, and cooked .
ome provi.
ion.
 and ate; after which we remained there two day.
.
 We then continued our voyage; and when twenty day.
 more had pa.
.
ed, we found our.
elve.
 in .
trange water.
, unknown to the captain, and de.
ired the watch to look out from the ma.
t head: .
o he went aloft, and when he had come down he .
aid to the captain: .
"I .
aw, on my right hand, fi.
h floating upon the .
urface of the water; and looking toward the mid.
t of the .
ea, I perceived .
omething looming in the di.
tance, .
ometime.
 black, and .
ometime.
 white.
.
".
n.
nWhen the captain heard thi.
 report of the watch, he threw hi.
 turban on the deck, and plucked hi.
 beard, and .
aid to tho.
e who were with him: .
"Receive warning of our de.
truction, which will befall all of u.
: not one will e.
cape!.
" So .
aying, he began to weep; and all of u.
 in like manner bewailed our lot.
 I de.
ired him to inform u.
 of that which the watch had .
een.
 .
"O my lord,.
" he replied, .
"know that we have wandered from our cour.
e .
ince the commencement of the contrary wind that wa.
 followed in the morning by a calm, in con.
equence of which we remained .
tationary two day.
: from that period we have deviated from our cour.
e for twenty-one day.
, and we have no wind to carry u.
 back from the fate which await.
 u.
 after thi.
 day.
 To-morrow we .
hall arrive at a mountain of black .
tone, called load.
tone: the current i.
 now bearing u.
 violently toward it, and the .
hip.
 will fall in piece.
, and every nail in them will fly to the mountain, and adhere to it; for God hath given to the load.
tone a .
ecret property by virtue of which everything of iron i.
 attracted toward it.
 On that mountain i.
 .
uch a quantity of iron a.
 no one knoweth but God, who.
e name be exalted; for from time.
 of old great number.
 of .
hip.
 have been de.
troyed by the influence of that mountain.
 There i.
, upon the .
ummit of the mountain, a cupola of bra.
.

 i.
 a hor.

on on board, and all the iron contained in it will cleave to the mountain: no one will be .
afe until the hor.

e.
.
" The captain then wept bitterly; and we felt a.
.
ured that our de.
truction wa.
 inevitable, and every one of u.
 bade adieu to hi.
 friend.
.
n.
nOn the following morning we drew near to the mountain; the current carried u.
 toward it with violence, and when the .
hip.
 were almo.
t clo.
e to it, they fell a.
under, and all the nail.
, and everything el.
e that wa.
 of iron, flew from them toward the load.
tone.
 It wa.
 near the clo.
e of day when the .
hip.
 fell in piece.
.
 Some of u.
 were drowned, and .
ome e.
caped; but the greater number were drowned, and of tho.
e who .
aved their live.
 none know what became of the other.
, .
o .
tupefied were they by the wave.
 and the boi.
terou.
 wind.
 A.
 for my.
elf, God, who.
e name be exalted, .
pared me on account of the trouble and torment and affliction that He had prede.
tined to befall me.
 I placed my.
elf upon a plank, and the wind and wave.
 ca.
t it upon the mountain; and when I had landed, I found a practicable way to the .
ummit, re.
embling .
tep.
 cut in the rock: .
o I exclaimed: .
"In the name of God!.
" and offered up a prayer, and attempted the a.
cent, holding fa.
t by the notche.
; and pre.
ently God .
tilled the wind, .
o that I arrived in .
afety at the .
ummit.
 Rejoicing greatly in my e.
cape, I immediately entered the cupola, and performed prayer.
 in gratitude to God for my pre.
ervation; after which I .
lept beneath the cupola, and heard a voice .
aying to me: .
"O .
on of Kha.
ib, when thou awake.

.

 of lead, whereon are engraved tali.

hoot at the hor.

prang up, and did a.

pread them upon the ground to dry, I .
lept; and in the morning I put on my clothe.

el came to the .
hore, and there landed from it ten black .
lave.

.
 They proceeded to the middle of the i.
land, and, digging up the earth, uncovered and lifted up a trap-door, after which they returned to the ve.

heep and everything that the want.
 of an inhabitant would require, continuing to pa.

 backward and forward between the ve.

cription, and in the mid.
t of them wa.
 an old .
heikh, enfeebled and wa.
ted by extreme age, leading by the hand a young man ca.
t in the mould of graceful .
ymmetry, and inve.
ted with .
uch perfect beauty a.
 de.
erved to be a .
ubject for proverb.
.
 He wa.
 like a fre.
h and .
lender twig, enchanting and captivating every heart by hi.
 elegant form.
 The party proceeded to the trap-door, and, entering it, became concealed from my eye.
.
.
n.
nThey remained beneath about two hour.
, or more; after which, the .
heikh and the .
lave.
 came out; but the youth came not with them; and they replaced the earth, and embarked and .
et .
ail.
 Soon after, I de.
cended from the tree, and went to the excavation.
 I removed the earth, and, entering the aperture, .
aw a flight of wooden .
tep.
, which I de.
cended; and, at the bottom, I beheld a hand.
ome dwelling-place, furni.
hed with a variety of .
ilken carpet.
; and there wa.
 the youth, .
itting upon a high mattre.
.
, with .
weet-.
melling flower.
 and fruit.
 placed before him.
 On .
eeing me, hi.
 countenance became pale; but I .
aluted him, and .
aid: .
"Let thy mind be compo.
ed, O my ma.
ter: thou ha.
t nothing to fear; for I am a man, and the .
on of a king, like thy.
elf: fate hath impelled me to thee, that I may cheer thee in thy .
olitude.
.
" The youth, when he heard me thu.
 addre.
.
 him, and wa.
 convinced that I wa.
 one of hi.
 own .
pecie.
, rejoiced exceedingly at my arrival, hi.
 colour returned, and, de.
iring me to approach him, he .
aid: .
"O my brother, my .
tory i.
 wonderful: my father i.
 a jeweller; he had .
lave.
 who made voyage.
 by hi.
 order.
, for the purpo.
e.
 of commerce, and he had dealing.
 with king.
; but he had never been ble.
t with a .
on; and he dreamt that he wa.
 .
oon to have a .
on, but one who.
e life would be .
hort; and he awoke .
orrowful.
 Shortly after, in accordance with the decree.
 of God, my mother gave birth to me; and my father wa.
 greatly rejoiced: the a.
trologer.
, however, came to him, and .
aid: Thy .
on will live fifteen year.
: hi.
 fate i.
 intimated by the fact that there i.
 in the .
ea a mountain called the Mountain of Load.
tone, whereon i.
 a hor.
eman on a hor.

on of King Kha.

 My father wa.
 greatly afflicted at thi.
 announcement; and when he had reared me until I had nearly attained the age of fifteen year.
, the a.
trologer.
 came again, and informed him that the hor.
eman had fallen into the .
ea, and that it had been thrown down by King Agib, the .
on of King Kha.
ib; on hearing which, he prepared for me thi.
 dwelling, and here left me to remain until the completion of the term, of which there now remain ten day.
.
 All thi.
 he did from fear le.
t King Agib .
hould kill me.
.
".
n.
nWhen I heard thi.
, I wa.
 filled with wonder, and .
aid within my.
elf: .
"I am King Agib, the .
on of King Kha.
ib, and it wa.
 I who threw down the hor.
eman; but, by Allah, I will neither kill him nor do him any injury.
.
" Then .
aid I to the youth: .
"Far from thee be both de.
truction and harm, if it be the will of God: thou ha.
t nothing to fear: I will remain with thee to .
erve thee, and will go forth with thee to thy father, and beg of him to .
end me back to my country, for the which he will obtain a reward.
.
" The youth rejoiced at my word.
, and I .
at and conver.

pread hi.
 bed for him, and covered him, and .
lept near to hi.
 .
ide.
 And in the morning I brought him water, and he wa.
hed hi.
 face, and .
aid to me: .
"May God requite thee for me with every ble.

ing.
 If I e.
cape from King Agib, I will make my father reward thee with abundant favour.
.
.
" .
"Never,.
" I replied, .
"may the day arrive that would bring thee mi.
fortune!.
" I then placed before him .
ome refre.

, and after we had eaten together, we pa.
.
ed the day conver.

t cheerfulne.
.
.
.
n.
nI continued to .
erve him for nine day.
; and on the tenth day the youth rejoiced at finding him.
elf in .
afety, and .
aid to me: .
"O my brother, I wi.
h that thou would.

.
 warm for me .

.
" .
"With plea.
ure,.
" I replied; and I aro.
e, and warmed the water; after which, he entered a place concealed from my view, and, having wa.
hed him.
elf and changed hi.
 clothe.
, laid him.
elf upon the mattre.
.
 to re.

 He then .
aid to me: .
"Cut up for me, O my brother, a water-melon, and mix it.
 juice with .

" .
o I aro.

aid to him; .
"Knowe.

" .
"See, here it i.

" he an.
wered, .
"upon the .

 I wa.
 drawing back, my foot .
lipped, a.
 God had decreed, and I fell upon the youth, gra.
ping in my hand the knife, which entered hi.
 body, and he died in.
tantly.
 When I perceived that he wa.
 dead, and that I had killed him, I uttered a loud .
hriek, and beat my face, and rent my clothe.
: .
aying: .
"Thi.
 i.
, indeed, a calamity! O my Lord, I implore thy pardon, and declare to Thee my innocence of hi.
 death! Would that I had died before him!.
".
n.
nWith the.

 I a.
cended the .
tep.
, and, having replaced the trap-door, returned to my fir.
t .
tation, and looked over the .
ea, where I .
aw the ve.

 in it.

e.
 Upon thi.
 I .
aid within my.
elf: .
"Now will the men come forth from the ve.
.
el, and find the youth .
lain, and they will .
lay me al.
o:.
" .
o I climbed into a tree, and concealed my.
elf among it.
 leave.
, and .
at there till the ve.
.
el arrived and ca.
t anchor, when the .
lave.
 landed with the old .
heikh, the father of the youth, and went to the place, and removed the earth.
 They were .
urpri.
ed at finding it moi.
t, and, when they had de.
cended the .
tep.
, they di.
covered the youth lying on hi.
 back, exhibiting a face beaming with beauty, though dead, and clad in white and clean clothing, with the knife remaining in hi.
 body.
 They all wept at the .
ight, and the father fell down in a .
woon, which la.
ted .
o long that the .
lave.
 thought he wa.
 dead.
 At length, however, he recovered, and came out with the .
lave.
, who had wrapped the body of the youth in hi.
 clothe.
.
 They then took back all that wa.
 in the .
ubterranean dwelling to the ve.
.
el, and departed.
.
n.
nI remained, by day hiding my.
elf in a tree, and at night walking about the open part of the i.
land.
 Thu.
 I continued for the .
pace of two month.
; and I perceived that, on the we.
tern .
ide of the i.
land, the water of the .
ea every day retired, until, after three month.
, the land that had been beneath it became dry.
 Rejoicing at thi.
, and feeling confident now in my e.
cape, I traver.
ed thi.
 dry tract, and arrived at an expan.
e of .
and; whereupon I emboldened my.
elf, and cro.
.
ed it.
 I then .
aw in the di.
tance an appearance of fire, and, advancing toward it, found it to be a palace, overlaid with plate.
 of red copper, which, reflecting the ray.
 of the .
un, .
eemed from a di.
tance to be fire: and when I drew near to it, reflecting upon thi.
 .
ight, there approached me an old .
heikh, accompanied by ten young men who were all blind of one eye, at which I wa.
 extremely .
urpri.
ed.
 A.
 .
oon a.
 they .
aw me, they .
aluted me, and a.
ked me my .
tory, which I related to them from fir.
t to la.
t; and they were filled with wonder.
 They then conducted me into the palace, where I .
aw ten benche.
, upon each of which wa.
 a mattre.
.
 covered with a blue .
tuff; and each of the young men .
eated him.
elf upon one of the.
e benche.
, while the .
heikh took hi.
 place upon a .
maller one; after which they .
aid to me: .
"Sit down, O young man, and a.
k no que.

pecting our being blind of one eye.
.
" Then the .
heikh aro.

ome food, and the .
ame to me al.

 .
ome wine: and after we had eaten, we .
at drinking together until the time for .

heikh: .
"Bring to u.

"—upon which the .
heikh aro.

 head, ten covered tray.
.
 Placing the.
e upon the floor, he lighted ten candle.
, and .
tuck one of them upon each tray; and, having done thi.
, he removed the cover.
, and there appeared beneath them a.
he.
 mixed with pounded charcoal.
 The young men then tucked up their .
leeve.
 above the elbow, and blackened their face.
, and .
lapped their cheek.
, exclaiming: .
"We were repo.

" Thu.
 they did until the morning, when the .
heikh brought them .
ome hot water, and they wa.

, and put on other clothe.
.
.
n.
nOn witne.
.

aid: .
"O young man, a.

" I remained with them a whole month, during which, every night they did the .

"I conjure you by Allah to remove thi.

.
" On hearing the.

, they replied: .
"We have not concealed thi.

"and do thou receive it, and a.

laughtered and .

aid to me: .
"Take thi.

".
n.
nThey then .
ewed me up in the .

oon after, there came an enormou.
 white bird, which .
eized me, and flew away with me, and .
et me down upon the mountain; whereupon I cut open the .

aw me, flew away.
 I ro.

" After having thu.

"Thou art from thi.

.
.
 So lovely were the.
e ladie.
, that even a devotee, if he .
aw them, would gladly con.

 At the approach of night they all a.
.
embled around me, and placed before me a table of fre.

ing, while another played upon the lute.
 The wine-cup.
 circulated among u.

 to obliterate from my mind every earthly care, and make me exclaim: .
"Thi.

"Would that we had never known thee; for we have a.

 May God, therefore, not deprive u.

"I wi.

"Thou,.

"Inform me,.

"If then thou would.

wore to them that I would never open the clo.

e.
.
n.
nI remained alone in the palace, and at the approach of evening I opened the fir.

 excepting that which they had forbidden me to open.
 My heart wa.
 then di.
turbed by curio.

 I had not patience to ab.

 Wondering at the .

"Thi.

" and, .
educed by the Devil, I led him out, and mounted him; but he moved not from hi.

 I kicked him with my heel; but .
till he moved not: .
o I took a .

 I walked upon the terrace, covering my eye with one of my hand.

nTHE STORY OF THE CITY OF BRASS.
nThere wa.
, in olden time, in Dama.
cu.
 of Syria, a king, named Abd-El-Melik the .
on of Marwan; and he wa.
 .
itting, one day, having with him the great men of hi.
 empire, con.
i.
ting of king.
 and .
ultan.
, when a di.
cu.
.
ion took place among them, re.
pecting the tradition.
 of former nation.
.
 They called to mind the .
torie.
 of Solomon, .
on of David, and the dominion which God had be.
towed upon him over mankind, and the genie.
, and the bird.
, and the wild bea.
t.
, and they .
aid: .
"We have heard from tho.
e who were before u.
, that God be.
towed not upon any one the power which He be.
towed upon Solomon, .
o that he u.
ed to impri.
on the genie.
 and the devil.
 in bottle.
 of bra.
.
, and pour molten lead over them, and .
eal a cover over them with hi.
 .
ignet.
.
".
n.
nThen Talib, one of the .
ultan.
, related, that a man once embarked in a .
hip with a company of other.
, and they voyaged to the i.
land of Sicily and cea.
ed not in their cour.
e until there aro.
e again.
t them a wind which bore them away to an unknown land.
 Thi.
 happened during the black darkne.
.
 of night, and when the day .
hone forth, there came out to them, from cave.
 in that land, people of black complexion and with naked bodie.
, like wild bea.
t.
, not under.
tanding .
peech.
 They had a king of their own race, and none of them knew Arabic .
ave their king.
 So when they .
aw the .
hip and tho.
e who were in her, he came forth to them attended by a party of hi.
 companion.
, and .
aluted them and welcomed them: They acquainted him with their .
tate; and he .
aid to them, .
"No harm .
hall befall you; there hath not come to u.
 any one of the .
on.
 of Adam before you.
.
" And he entertained them with a banquet of the fle.
h of bird.
 and of wild bea.
t.
 and of fi.
h.
 And after thi.
, the people of the .
hip went down to divert them.
elve.
 in the city, and they found one of the fi.
hermen who had ca.
t hi.
 net in the .
ea to catch fi.
h, and he drew it up, and, lo, in it wa.
 a bottle of bra.
.
 .
topped with lead, which wa.
 .
ealed with the .
ignet of Solomon the .
on of David.
 And the fi.
herman came forth and broke it; whereupon there proceeded from it a blue .
moke, which united with the cloud.
 of heaven; and they heard a horrible voice, .
aying: .
"Repentance! repentance! O Prophet of God!.
" Then, of that .
moke there wa.
 formed a per.
on of terrible a.
pect, of terrific make, who.
e head would reach a.
 high a.
 a mountain; and he di.
appeared from before their eye.
.
 A.
 to the people of the .
hip, their heart.
 were almo.
t eradicated; but the black.
 thought nothing of the event.
 And a man returned to the king, and a.
ked him re.
pecting thi.
; and the king an.
wered him: .
"Know that thi.
 i.
 one of the genie.
 whom Solomon, the .
on of David, when he wa.
 incen.
ed again.
t them, impri.
oned in the.
e bottle.
, and he poured lead over them, and threw them into the .
ea.
 When the fi.
herman ca.
teth hi.
 net, it generally bringeth up the.
e bottle.
; and when they are broken, there cometh forth from them a genie, who imagineth that Solomon i.
 .
till living; wherefore he repenteth, and .
aith: 'Repentance! O Prophet of God!'.
".
n.
nAnd the Prince of the Faithful, Abd-El-Melik, wondered at the.
e word.
, and .
aid: .
"By Allah, I de.
ire to .
ee .
ome of the.
e bottle.
!.
" So Talib replied: .
"O Prince of the Faithful, thou art able to do .
o, and yet remain in thy country.
 Send to thy brother Abd-El-Azeez, that he may write order.
 to the Emeer Moo.
a to journey from the We.
tern Country to thi.
 mountain which we have mentioned, and to bring thee what thou de.
ire.
t of the.
e bottle.
; for the furthe.
t tract of hi.
 province i.
 adjacent to thi.
 mountain.
.
" And the Prince of the Faithful approved of hi.
 advice, and .
aid: .
"O Talib, thou ha.
t .
poken truth and I de.
ire that thou be my me.
.
enger to Moo.
a for thi.
 purpo.
e.
.
" To thi.
, Talib replied: .
"Mo.
t willingly, O Prince of the Faithful.
.
" And the king .
aid to him: .
"Go in dependence on the ble.
.
ing of God, and hi.
 aid.
.
" Then he gave order.
 that they .
hould write for him a letter to hi.
 brother Abd-El-Azeez, hi.
 viceroy in Egypt, and another letter to Moo.
a, hi.
 viceroy in the We.
tern Country, commanding him to journey, him.
elf, in .
earch of the bottle.
 of Solomon.
 He .
ealed the two letter.
, and delivered them to Talib, commanding him to ha.
ten, and he gave him riche.
 and rider.
 and footmen to aid him in hi.
 way.
.
n.
nSo Talib went forth on hi.
 way to Egypt, and when the Emeer Moo.
a knew of hi.
 approach, he went forth to him and met him, and rejoiced at hi.
 arrival; and Talib handed to him the letter.
 So he took it and read it, and under.
tood it.
 meaning; and he put it upon hi.
 head, .
aying: .
"I hear and obey the command of the Prince of the Faithful.
.
" He determined to .
ummon hi.
 great men; and they pre.
ented them.
elve.
; and he inquired of them re.
pecting that which had been made known to him by the letter; whereupon they .
aid: .
"O Emeer, if thou de.
ire him who will guide thee to that place, have recour.
e to the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad; for he i.
 a knowing man, and hath travelled much, and he i.
 acquainted with the de.
ert.
 and wa.
te.
 and the .
ea.
, and their inhabitant.
 and their wonder.
, and the countrie.
 and their di.
trict.
.
 Have recour.
e therefore to him, and he will direct thee to the object of thy de.
ire.
.
" Accordingly he gave order.
 to bring him, and he came before him; and, lo, he wa.
 a very old man, whom the vici.
.
itude.
 of year.
 and time.
 had rendered decrepit.
 The Emeer Moo.
a .
aluted him, and .
aid to him: .
"O Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad, our lord, the Prince of the Faithful, hath commanded u.
 thu.
 and thu.
, and I po.
.
e.
.

.
 Ha.
t thou then a wi.
h to accompli.
h the affair of the Prince of the Faithful?.
" The .
heikh replied: .
"Know, O Emeer, that thi.
 route i.
 difficult, far extending, with few track.
.
.
" The emeer .
aid to him: .
"How long a period doth it require?.
" He an.
wered: .
"It i.
 a journey of two year.
 and .
ome month.
 going, and the like returning; and on the way are difficultie.
 and horror.
, and extraordinary and wonderful thing.
.
 But,.
" he .
aid, .
"God will a.
.
uredly make thi.
 affair ea.
y to u.
 through the ble.
.
ing attendant upon thee, O Viceroy of the Prince of the Faithful.
.
".
n.
nAfter thi.
 they departed, and they continued their journey until they arrived at a palace; whereupon the .
heikh .
aid: .
"Advance with u.
 to thi.
 palace, which pre.
enteth a le.
.
on to him who will be admoni.
hed.
.
" So the Emeer Moo.
a advanced thither, together with the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad and hi.
 chief companion.
, till they came to it.
 entrance.
 And they found it open, and having lofty angle.
, and .
tep.
, among which were two wide .
tep.
 of coloured marble.
, the like of which hath not been .
een: the ceiling.
 and wall.
 were decorated with gold and .
ilver and mineral.
, and over the entrance wa.
 a .
lab, whereon wa.
 an in.
cription in ancient Greek; and the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad .
aid: .
"Shall I read it, O Emeer?.
" The emeer an.
wered; .
"Advance and read.
.
" So he read it; and, lo, it wa.
 poetry; and it wa.
 thi.
:.
n.
nHere wa.
 a people whom, after their work.
, thou .
halt .
ee wept over for their lo.
t dominion;.
nAnd in thi.
 palace i.
 the la.
t information re.
pecting lord.
 collected in the du.
t.
.
nDeath hath de.
troyed them and di.
united them, and in the du.
t they have lo.
t what they ama.
.
ed;.
nA.
 though they had only put down their load.
 to re.
t a while: quickly have they departed!.
n.
nAnd the Emeer Moo.
a wept and .
aid: .
"There i.
 no deity but God, the Living, the Enduring without failure!.
".
n.
nThen they attentively viewed the palace; and, lo, it wa.
 devoid of inhabitant.
, de.
titute of hou.
ehold and occupant.
: it.
 court.
 were de.
olate, and it.
 apartment.
 were de.
erted; and in the mid.
t of it wa.
 a chamber covered with a lofty dome, ri.
ing high into the air, around which were four hundred tomb.
.
.
n.
nAnd the Emeer Moo.
a drew near to the dome-crowned chamber, and, lo, it had eight door.
 of .
andalwood, with nail.
 of gold, ornamented with .
tar.
 of .
ilver .
et with variou.
 jewel.
, and he beheld in it a long tomb, of terrible appearance, whereon wa.
 a tablet of iron of China; and the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad drew near to it, and read it.
 in.
cription; and, lo, on it wa.
 written:.
n.
nShould.
t thou think upon me after the length of my age, and the vici.
.
itude.
 of day.
 and circum.
tance.
,.
nI am the .
on of Sheddad, who held dominion over mankind and each tract of the whole earth.
.
nAll the .
tubborn troop.
 became abject unto me, and E.
h-Sham from Mi.
r unto Adnan.
.
nIn glory I reigned, aba.
ing their king.
, the people of the earth fearing my dominion;.
nAnd I beheld the tribe.
 and armie.
 in my power, and .
aw the countrie.
 and their inhabitant.
 dread me.
.
nWhen I mounted, I beheld my army compri.
ing a million bridle.
 upon neighing .
teed.
;.
nAnd I po.
.
e.
.
ed wealth that could not be calculated, which I trea.
ured up again.
t mi.
fortune.
,.
nDetermining to devote the whole of my property for the purpo.
e of extending the term of my life.
.
n.
nBut the Deity would nought .
ave the execution of hi.
 purpo.
e; and thu.
 I became .
eparated from my brethren.
.
nDeath, the di.
uniter of mankind, came to me, and I wa.
 removed from grandeur to the man.
ion of contempt;.
nAnd I found the recompen.
e of all my pa.

, for which I am pledged: for I wa.
 .
inful!.
nThen rai.
e thy.
elf, le.
t thou be upon a brink; and beware of calamitie.
! Maye.
t thou be led aright!.
n.
nAnd again the Emeer Moo.
a wept, in con.
idering the fate.
 of the people; after which, a.
 they were going about through the different apartment.
 of the palace, and viewing attentively it.
 chamber.
 and it.
 place.
 of diver.
ion, they came to a table upon four leg.
 of alaba.
ter, whereon wa.
 in.
cribed:.
n.
nUpon thi.
 table have eaten a thou.
and one-eyed king.
, and a thou.
and king.
 each .
ound in both eye.
.
 All of them have quitted the world, and taken up their abode in the burial-ground.
 and the grave.
.
.
n.
nAnd the Emeer Moo.
a wrote down all thi.
.
 Then he went forth, and took not with him from the palace aught .
ave the table.
.
n.
nThe .
oldier.
 proceeded, with the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad before them .
hewing them the way, until all the fir.
t day had pa.
.
ed, and the .
econd, and the third.
 They then came to a high hill, at which they looked, and, lo, upon it wa.
 a hor.
eman of bra.
.
, on the top of who.
e .
pear wa.
 a wide and gli.
tening head that almo.
t deprived the beholder of .
ight, and on it wa.
 in.
cribed:.
n.
nO thou who come.
t unto me, if thou know not the way that leadeth to the City of Bra.
.
, rub the hand of the hor.
eman, and he will turn, and then will .
top, and in what.
oever direction he .
toppeth, thither proceed, without fear and without difficulty; for it will lead thee to the City of Bra.
.
.
.
n.
nAnd when the Emeer Moo.
a had rubbed the hand of the hor.
eman, it turned like the blinding lightning, and faced a different direction from that in which they were travelling.
.
n.
nThe party therefore turned thither and journeyed on, and it wa.
 the right way.
 They took that route, and continued their cour.
e the .
ame day and the next night until they had traver.
ed a wide tract of country.
 And a.
 they were proceeding, one day, they came to a pillar of black .
tone, wherein wa.
 a per.
on .
unk to hi.
 arm-pit.
, and he had two huge wing.
, and four arm.
; two of them like tho.
e of the .
on.
 of Adam, and two like the fore-leg.
 of lion.
, with claw.
.
 He had hair upon hi.
 head like the tail.
 of hor.
e.
, and two eye.
 like two burning coal.
, and he had a third eye, in hi.
 forehead, like the eye of the lynx, from which there appeared .
park.
 of fire.
 He wa.
 black and tall; and he wa.
 crying out: .
"Extolled be the perfection of my Lord, who hath appointed me thi.
 .
evere affliction and painful torture until the day of re.
urrection!.
" When the party beheld him, their rea.
on fled from them, and they were .
tupefied at the .
ight of hi.
 form, and retreated in flight; and the Emeer Moo.
a .
aid to the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad: .
"What i.
 thi.
?.
" He an.
wered: .
"I know not what he i.
.
.
" And the emeer .
aid: .
"Draw near to him, and inve.
tigate hi.
 ca.
e: perhap.
 he will di.
cover it, and perhap.
 thou wilt learn hi.
 hi.
tory.
.
" So the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad drew near to him, and .
aid to him: .
"O thou per.
on, what i.
 thy name, and what i.
 thy nature, and what hath placed thee here in thi.
 manner?.
" And the per.
on an.
wered him: .
"A.
 to me, I am an efreet of the genie.
, and my name i.
 Dahi.
h, and I am re.
trained here by the maje.

.
" Then the Emeer Moo.
a .
aid: .
"O Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad, a.
k him what i.

 pillar.
.
" He therefore a.
ked re.
pecting that, and the efreet an.
wered him: .
"Verily my .
tory i.

n.
n.
"There belonged to one of the .
on.
 of Iblee.
 an idol of red carnelian, of which I wa.
 made guardian; and there u.
ed to wor.

 of the Sea, of great glory, leading, among hi.
 troop.
 of the genie.
, a million warrior.
 who .
mote with .
word.
 before him, and who an.
wered hi.
 prayer in ca.
e.
 of difficulty.
 The.
e genie.
 who obeyed him were under my command and authority, following my word.
 when I ordered them: all of them were in rebellion again.
t Solomon, the .
on of David; and I u.
ed to enter the body of the idol, and command them and forbid them.
 Now the daughter of that king wa.
 a frequent adorer of the idol, a.
.
iduou.
 in the wor.
hip of it, and .
he wa.
 the hand.
ome.
t of the people of her age, endowed with beauty and loveline.
.
, and elegance and perfection; and I de.
cribed her to Solomon, on whom be peace! So he .
ent to her father, .
aying to him: 'Marry to me thy daughter, and break thy carnelian-idol, and bear witne.
.
 that there i.
 no deity but God, and that Solomon i.
 the Prophet of God.
 But if thou refu.

 that .
hall leave thee like ye.
terday that hath pa.

' And when the me.
.
enger of Solomon came to him, the King of the Sea wa.
 in.
olent, and magnified him.
elf and wa.
 proud.
 Then he .
aid to hi.
 vizier.
: 'What .
ay ye re.
pecting the affair of Solomon? For he hath .
ent demanding my daughter, and commanding me to break my carnelian-idol, and to adopt hi.

' And they replied: 'O great King, can Solomon do aught unto thee, when thou art in the mid.

ea? He cannot prevail again.
t thee; .
ince the genie.

 The right opinion i.
, that thou con.

' And upon thi.
 the king went immediately, and, going in to hi.
 idol, after he had offered a .
acrifice and .
lain victim.
, fell down before it pro.
trate, and began to weep, and to .
eek coun.

.
n.
n.
"Thereupon I entered the body of the idol, by rea.

n'A.
 for me, I am not in fear of him; for I am acquainted with everything.
.
nIf he wi.

'.
n.
nSo when the king heard my reply to him, hi.
 heart wa.
 .
trengthened, and he determined to wage war with Solomon the Prophet of God and to fight again.
t him.
 Accordingly, when the me.
.
enger of Solomon came, he inflicted upon him a painful beating, and returned him a .
hameful reply; and he .
ent to threaten Solomon, .
aying to him, by the me.
.
enger: 'Do.
t thou threaten me with fal.

? Either come thou to me, or I will go to thee.
'.
n.
n.
"Then the me.
.
enger returned to Solomon, and acquainted him with all that had occurred.
 And when the Prophet of God heard that, hi.
 re.
olution wa.
 rou.

 force.
, con.
i.
ting of genie.
 and men, and wild bea.
t.
, and bird.

.
 He commanded hi.
 vizier, Ed-Dimiryat, the king of the genie.
, to collect them from every place: .
o he collected for him, of the devil.
, .
ix hundred million.
.
 He al.
o commanded A.
af, hi.
 vizier of men, to collect hi.
 .
oldier.
 of mankind; and their number wa.
 one million, or more.
 He made ready the accoutrement.
 and weapon.
, and mounted, with hi.
 force.
, upon the magic carpet, with the bird.
 flying over hi.
 head, and the wild bea.
t.
 beneath the carpet marching, until he alighted upon hi.
 enemy'.
 coa.
t, and .
urrounded hi.
 i.
land, having filled the land with the force.
.
 He then .

aying to him: 'Behold, I have arrived: therefore .

 But if thou refu.

hall not prevent thee: for God hath commanded the wind to obey me, and I will order it to convey me unto thee on the carpet, and will make thee an example to re.

' So the me.
.
enger came to him, and communicated to him the me.

age of the Prophet! But the king .
aid to him: 'There i.
 no way for the accompli.

 thing that he requireth: therefore inform him that I am coming forth unto him.
' Accordingly the me.
.
enger returned to Solomon, and gave him the reply.
 The king then .

 And a.
 to the Prophet of God, he di.

 He ordered them al.

et for him.
elf a couch of alaba.

.
n.
n.
"After thi.
, they came upon u.
 all together, and we contended with him in a wide tract for a period of two day.
; and calamity befell u.
 on the third day, and the decree of God wa.
 executed among u.
.
 The fir.
t who charged upon Solomon were I and my troop.
; and I .
aid to my companion.
: 'Keep in your place.
 in the battle-field while I go forth to them and challenge Ed-Dimiryat.
' And, lo, he came forth, like a great mountain, hi.
 fire.
 flaming, and hi.

mote me with a flaming fire; and hi.
 arrow prevailed over my fire.
 He cried out at me with a prodigiou.

 Then he commanded hi.

 The bird.

 and troop.
 were enervated, and my tribe.
 were routed.
 I flew from before Ed-Dimiryat; but he followed me a journey of three month.
, until he overtook me.
 I had fallen down through fatigue, and he ru.
hed upon me, and made me a pri.
oner.
 So I .
aid to him: 'By Him who hath exalted thee and aba.
ed me, pity me, and take me before Solomon.
' But when I came before Solomon, he met me in a mo.
t evil manner: he cau.
ed thi.
 pillar to be brought, and hollowed it, and put me in it, and .
ealed me with hi.
 .
ignet; after which, he chained me, and Ed-Dimiryat conveyed me to thi.
 place, where he .
et me down a.
 thou .
ee.
t me; and thi.
 pillar i.
 my pri.
on until the day of re.
urrection.
.
".
n.
nThe party therefore wondered at him, and at the horrible nature of hi.
 form; and the Emeer Moo.
a .
aid: .
"There i.
 no deity but God!.
" And the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad .
aid to the efreet: .
"O thou, I a.
k thee concerning a thing of which do thou inform u.
.
.
" The efreet replied: .
"A.
k concerning what thou wilt.
.
" And the .
heikh .
aid: .
"Are there in thi.
 place any of the efreet.
 confined in bottle.
 of bra.
.
 from the time of Solomon?.
" He an.
wered: .
"Ye.
, in the Sea of El-Karkar, where are a people of the de.
cendant.
 of Noah, who.
e country the deluge reached not, and they are .
eparated there from the re.

 of Adam.
.
" .
"And where,.
" .
aid the .
heikh, .
"i.
 the way to the City of Bra.
.
, and the place wherein are the bottle.
? What di.
tance i.
 there between u.
 and it?.
" The efreet an.
wered: .
"It i.
 near.
.
" So the party left him, and proceeded; and there appeared to them in the di.
tance a great black object, with two fire.
 corre.
ponding with each other in po.
ition; whereupon the Emeer Moo.
a .
aid to the .
heikh: .
"What i.
 thi.
 great black object, and the.
e two corre.
ponding fire.
?.
" The guide an.
wered him: .
"Be rejoiced, O Emeer; for thi.
 i.
 the City of Bra.
.
, and thi.
 i.
 the appearance of it that I find de.
cribed in the Book of Hidden Trea.
ure.
; that it.
 wall i.
 of black .
tone.
, and it hath two tower.
 of bra.
.
, which the beholder .
eeth re.
embling two corre.
ponding fire.
; and thence it i.
 named the City of Bra.
.
.
.
" They cea.
ed not to proceed until they arrived at it; and, lo, it wa.
 lofty, .
trongly fortified, ri.
ing high into the air, impenetrable: the height of it.
 wall.
 wa.
 eighty cubit.
, and it had five and twenty gate.
, none of which would open but by mean.
 of .
ome artifice.
 They .
topped before it, and endeavoured to di.
cover one of it.
 gate.
; but they could not; and the Emeer Moo.
a .
aid to the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad: .
"O .
heikh, I .
ee not to thi.
 city any gate.
.
" The .
heikh replied: .
"O Emeer, thu.
 do I find it de.
cribed in the Book of Hidden Trea.
ure.
; that it hath five and twenty gate.
, and that none of it.

 may be opened but from within the city.
.
" .
"And how,.
" .
aid the emeer, .
"can we contrive to enter it, and divert our.

 wonder.
?.
".
n.
nThen the Emeer Moo.
a ordered one of hi.
 young men to mount a camel, and ride round the city, in the hope that he might di.
cover a trace of a gate.
 So one of hi.
 young men mounted, and proceeded around it for two day.
 with their night.
, pro.
ecuting hi.
 journey with diligence, and not re.
ting; and when the third day arrived, he came in .
ight of hi.
 companion.
, and he wa.
 a.
tounded at that which he beheld of the extent of the city, and it.
 height.
 Then he .
aid: .
"O Emeer, the ea.
ie.
t place in it i.
 thi.
 place at which ye have alighted.
.
" And thereupon the Emeer Moo.
a took Talib and the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad, and they a.
cended a mountain oppo.
ite the city, and overlooking it; and when they had a.
cended that mountain, they .
aw a city than which eye.
 had not beheld any greater.
 It.
 pavilion.
 were lofty, and it.
 dome.
 were .
hining; it.
 river.
 were running, it.
 tree.
 were fruitful, and it.
 garden.
 bore ripe produce.
 It wa.
 a city with impenetrable gate.
, empty, .
till, without a voice but the owl hooting in it.
 quarter.
, and the raven croaking in it.
 thoroughfare-.
treet.
, and bewailing tho.
e who had been in it.
.
n.
nmountain.
n.
nAnd when they had a.
cended that mountain they .
aw a city than which eye.
 had not beheld any greater.
.
n.
nAnd the Emeer Moo.
a fainted with .
orrow; hi.
 tear.
 ran down upon hi.
 cheek.
, and he .
aid: .
"By Allah, indifference to the world i.
 the mo.
t appropriate and the mo.
t .

".
n.
nAnd when they came back to the troop.
, they pa.
.
ed the day devi.
ing mean.
 of entering the city; and the Emeer Moo.
a .
aid to tho.
e of hi.
 chief officer.
 who were around him: .
"How .
hall we contrive to enter the city, that we may .
ee it.
 wonder.
? Perhap.
 we .
hall find in it .
omething by which we may ingratiate our.
elve.
 with the Prince of the Faithful.
.
" Talib replied: .
"Let u.
 make a ladder, and mount upon it, and perhap.
 we .
hall gain acce.
.
 to the gate from within.
.
" And the emeer .
aid: .
"Thi.
 i.
 what occurred to my mind, and excellent i.
 the advice.
.
" Then he called to the carpenter.
 and black.
mith.
, and ordered them to make .
traight .
ome piece.
 of wood, and to con.
truct a ladder covered with plate.
 of iron.
 And they did .
o, and made it .
trong.
 They employed them.
elve.
 in con.
tructing it a whole month, and many men were occupied in making it.
 And they .
et it up and fixed it again.
t the wall, and it proved to be equal to the wall in height, a.
 though it had been made for it before that day.
 So the Emeer Moo.
a wondered at it, and .
aid: .
"God ble.
.
 you! It .
eemeth, from the excellence of your work, a.
 though ye had adapted it by mea.
urement to the wall.
.
" He then .
aid to the people: .
"Which of you will a.
cend thi.
 ladder, and mount upon the wall, and walk along it, and contrive mean.
 of de.
cending into the city, that he may .
ee how the ca.
e i.
, and then inform u.
 of the mode of opening the gate?.
" And one of them an.
wered: .
"I will a.
cend it, O Emeer, and de.
cend and open the gate.
.
" The emeer therefore replied: .
"Mount.
 God ble.
.
 thee!.
" Accordingly, the man a.
cended the ladder until he reached the top of it; when he .
tood, and fixed hi.
 eye.
 toward the city, clapped hi.
 hand.
, and cried out with hi.
 loude.
t voice, .
aying: .
"Thou art beautiful!.
" Then he ca.
t him.
elf down into the city, and wa.
 de.
troyed.
 So the Emeer Moo.
a .
aid: .
"If we do thu.
 with all our companion.
, there will not remain of them one; and we .
hall be unable to accompli.
h our affair, and the affair of the Prince of the Faithful.
 Depart ye; for we have no concern with thi.
 city.
.
" But one of them .
aid: .
"Perhap.
 another than thi.
 may be more .
teady than he.
.
" And a .
econd a.
cended, and a third, and a fourth, and a fifth; and they cea.
ed not to a.
cend by that ladder to the top of the wall, one after another, until twelve men of them had gone, acting a.
 acted the fir.
t.
 Therefore the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad .
aid: .
"There i.
 none for thi.
 affair but my.
elf, and the experienced i.
 not like the inexperienced.
.
" But the Emeer Moo.
a .
aid to him: .
"Thou .
halt not do that, nor will I allow thee to a.
cend to the top of thi.
 wall; for .
hould.
t thou die, thou would.
t be the cau.
e of the death of u.
 all, and there would not remain of u.

ince thou art the guide of the party.
.
" The .
heikh, however, replied: .
"Perhap.
 the object will be accompli.
hed by my mean.
, through the will of God, who.
e name be exalted!.
" And thereupon all the people agreed to hi.
 a.
cending.
.
n.
nThen Abd-E.
-Samad aro.
e, and, having .
aid: .
"In the name of God, the Compa.

"—he a.
cended the ladder, repeating the prai.
e.
 of God, and reciting the Ver.
e.
 of Safety, until he reached the top of the wall; when he clapped hi.
 hand.
, and fixed hi.
 eye.
.
 The people therefore all called out to him, and .
aid: .
"O Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad, do not ca.
t thy.

-Samad fall, we all peri.
h!.
" Then Abd-E.
-Samad .
at a long time repeating the prai.

 of God, and reciting the Ver.
e.
 of Safety; after which he ro.
e with energy, and called out with hi.
 loude.
t voice: .
"O Emeer, no harm .
hall befall you; for God hath averted from me the effect of the artifice of the Devil.
.
" So the emeer .
aid to him: .
"What ha.
t thou .
een, O Sheikh?.
" He an.
wered: .
"When I reached the top of the wall I beheld ten dam.
el.
, like moon.
, who made a .
ign with their hand.
, a.
 though they would .
ay: 'Come to u.
!' And it .
eemed to me that beneath me wa.
 a .
ea of water; whereupon I de.
ired to ca.
t my.

 our companion.
 did: but I beheld them dead; .
o I withheld my.
elf from them, and recited .
ome word.
 of the book of God, whereupon He averted from me the influence of tho.
e dam.
el.
, and they departed; therefore I ca.
t not my.
elf down.
 There i.
 no doubt that thi.
 i.
 an enchantment which the people of thi.
 city contrived in order to repel from it every one who .
hould wi.
h to obtain acce.
.
 to it.
.
".
n.
nHe then walked along the wall till he came to the two tower.
 of bra.
.
, when he .
aw that they had gate.
 of gold, without any .
ign of the mean.
 of opening them.
 Therefore the .
heikh, looking attentively, .
aw in the middle of one of the gate.
 a figure of a hor.
eman of bra.
.
, having one hand extended, a.
 though he were pointing with it, and on it wa.
 an in.
cription, which the .
heikh read, and, lo, it contained the.
e word.
:.
n.
nTurn the pin that i.
 in the middle of the front of the hor.
eman'.
 body twelve time.
, and then the gate will open.
.
n.
nSo he turned the pin twelve time.
; whereupon the gate opened immediately, with a noi.
e like thunder; and the .
heikh entered.
 He wa.
 a learned man, acquainted with all language.
 and character.
.
 And he walked on until he entered a long pa.
.
age, whence he de.
cended .
ome .
tep.
, and he found a place with hand.
ome wooden benche.
, on which were people dead, and over their head.
 were elegant .
hield.
, and keen .
word.
, and .
trung bow.
, and notched arrow.
.
 And behind the next gate were a bar of iron, and barricade.
 of wood, and lock.
 of delicate fabric, and .
trong apparatu.
.
 Upon thi.
, the .
heikh .
aid within him.
elf: .
"Perhap.
 the key.
 are with the.
e people.
.
" Then he looked, and, lo, there wa.
 a .
heikh who appeared to be the olde.
t of them, and he wa.
 upon a high wooden bench among the dead men.
 So Abd-E.
-Samad .
aid: .
"May not the key.
 of the city be with thi.
 .
heikh! Perhap.
 he wa.
 the gate-keeper of the city, and the.
e were under hi.
 authority.
.
" He therefore drew near to him, and lifted up hi.
 garment.
, and, lo, the key.
 were hung to hi.
 wai.
t.
 At the .
ight of them, Abd-E.
-Samad rejoiced exceedingly; and he took the key.
, opened the lock.
, and pulled the gate and the barricade.
 and other apparatu.
, which opened and the gate al.
o opened, with a noi.
e like thunder.
 Upon thi.
 the .
heikh exclaimed: .
"God i.
 mo.
t great!.
" and the people made the .
ame exclamation with him, rejoicing at the event.
 The Emeer Moo.
a al.
o rejoiced at the .
afety of Abd-E.
-Samad, and at the opening of the gate of the city; the people thanked him for that which he had done, and all the troop.
 ha.
tened to enter the gate.
 But the Emeer Moo.
a cried out to them, .
aying to them: .
"O people, if all of u.
 enter, we .
hall not be .
ecure from accident.
 Half .
hall enter, and half .
hall remain behind.
.
".
n.
nThe Emeer Moo.
a then entered the gate, and with him half of the people, who bore their weapon.
 of war.
 And the party .
aw their companion.
 lying dead: .
o they buried them.
 They .
aw al.
o the gate-keeper.
 and .
ervant.
 and chamberlain.
 and lieutenant.
 lying upon bed.
 of .
ilk, all of them dead.
 And they entered the market of the city, and beheld that the .
hop.
 were open, and the .
cale.
 hung up, and the uten.
il.
 of bra.
.
 ranged in order, and the .
tore.
 were full of all kind.
 of good.
.
 And they .
aw the merchant.
 dead in their .
hop.
: their .
kin.
 were dried, and they had become example.
 to him who would be admoni.
hed.
 And they left thi.
 place, and pa.
.
ed on to the .
ilk-market, in which were .
ilk.
 and brocade.
 interwoven with red gold and white .
ilver upon variou.
 colour.
, and the owner.
 were dead, lying upon .
kin.
, and appearing almo.
t a.
 though they would .
peak.
 Leaving the.
e, they went on to the market of jewel.
 and pearl.
 and jacinth.
; and they left it, and pa.
.
ed on to the market of the money-changer.
, whom they found dead, with varietie.
 of .
ilk.
 beneath them, and their .
hop.
 were filled with gold and .
ilver.
 The.
e they left, and they proceeded to the market.
 of the perfumer.
; and, lo, their .
hop.
 were filled with varietie.
 of perfume.
, and bag.
 of mu.
k, and ambergri.
, and aloe.
-wood, and camphor; and the owner.
 were all dead, not having with them any food.
 And when they went forth from the market of the perfumer.
, they found near unto it a palace, decorated, and .
trongly con.
tructed; and they entered it, and found banner.
 unfurled, and drawn .
word.
, and .
trung bow.
 and .
hield.
 hung up by chain.
 of gold and .
ilver, and helmet.
 gilded with red gold.
 And in the pa.
.
age.
 of that palace were benche.
 of ivory, ornamented with plate.
 of brilliant gold, and with .
ilk, on which were men who.
e .
kin.
 had dried upon the bone.
; the ignorant would imagine them to be .
leeping; but, from the want of food, they had died, and ta.
ted mortality.
.
n.
nAnd the Emeer Moo.
a went on into the interior of the palace.
 There he beheld a great hall, and four large and lofty chamber.
, each one fronting another, wide, decorated with gold and .
ilver and with variou.
 colour.
.
 In the mid.
t of the hall wa.
 a great fountain of alaba.
ter, over which wa.
 a canopy of brocade; and in tho.
e chamber.
 were fountain.
 lined with marble; and channel.
 of water flowed along the floor.
 of tho.
e chamber.
, the four .
tream.
 meeting in a great tank lined with marble.
 of variou.
 colour.
.
 The Emeer Moo.
a then .
aid to the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad: .
"Enter the.
e chamber.
 with u.
.
.
" So they entered the fir.
t chamber; and they found it filled with gold and with white .
ilver, and pearl.
 and jewel.
, and jacinth.
 and preciou.
 mineral.
.
 They found in it al.
o che.
t.
 full of red and yellow and white brocade.
.
 And they went thence to the .
econd chamber, and opened a clo.
et in it, and, lo, it wa.
 filled with arm.
 and weapon.
 of war, con.
i.
ting of gilded helmet.
, and coat.
 of mail, and .
word.
, and lance.
, and mace.
, and other in.
trument.
 of war and battle.
 Then they pa.
.
ed thence to the third chamber, in which they found clo.
et.
 having upon their door.
 clo.
ed lock.
, and over them were curtain.
 worked with variou.
 kind.
 of embroidery.
 They opened one of the.
e clo.
et.
, and found it filled with weapon.
 decorated with varietie.
 of gold and .
ilver and jewel.
.
 And they went thence to the fourth chamber, where al.
o they found clo.
et.
, one of which they opened, and they found it full of uten.
il.
 for food and drink, con.
i.
ting of variou.
 ve.
.
el.
 of gold and .
ilver, and .
aucer.
 of cry.
tal, and cup.
 .
et with brilliant pearl.
 and cup.
 of carnelian, and other thing.
.
 So they began to take what .
uited them of tho.
e thing.
, and each of the .
oldier.
 carried off what he could.
 And when they determined to go forth from tho.
e chamber.
, they .
aw there a door inlaid with ivory and ebony, and adorned with plate.
 of brilliant gold.
 Over it wa.
 hung a curtain of .
ilk worked with variou.
 kind.
 of embroidery, and upon it were lock.
 of white .
ilver, to be opened by artifice, without a key.
 The Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad therefore advanced to tho.
e lock.
, and he opened them by hi.
 knowledge and excellent .
kill.
 And the party entered a pa.
.
age paved with marble, upon the .
ide.
 of which were curtain.
 whereon were figured variou.
 wild bea.
t.
 and bird.
, all the.
e being worked with red gold and white .
ilver, and their eye.
 were of pearl.
 and jacinth.
: who.
oever beheld them wa.
 confounded.
.
n.
nThey then pa.
.
ed on, and found a .
aloon con.
tructed of poli.
hed marble adorned with jewel.
.
 The beholder imagined that upon it.
 floor wa.
 running water, and if any one walked upon it he would .
lip.
 The Emeer Moo.
a therefore ordered the Sheikh Abd-E.
-Samad to throw upon it .
omething that they might be enabled to walk on it; and he did thi.
, and contrived .
o that they pa.
.
ed on.
 And they found in it a great dome con.
tructed of .
tone.
 gilded with red gold.
 The party had not beheld, in all that they had .
een, anything more beautiful than it.
 And in the mid.
t of that dome wa.
 a great dome-crowned .
tructure of alaba.
ter, around which were lattice window.
, decorated, and adorned with oblong emerald.
, .
uch a.
 none of the king.
 could procure.
 In it wa.
 a pavilion of brocade, rai.
ed upon column.
 of red gold, and within thi.
 were bird.
, the feet of which were of emerald.
; beneath each bird wa.
 a net of brilliant pearl.
, .
pread over a fountain; and by the brink of the fountain wa.
 placed a couch adorned with pearl.
 and jewel.
 and jacinth.
, whereon wa.
 a dam.
el re.
embling the .
hining .
un.
 Eye.
 had not beheld one more beautiful.
 Upon her wa.
 a garment of brilliant pearl.
, on her head wa.
 a crown of red gold, with a fillet of jewel.
, on her neck wa.
 a necklace of jewel.
 in the middle of which were refulgent gem.
, and upon her forehead were two jewel.
 the light of which wa.
 like that of the .
un; and .
he .
eemed a.
 though .
he were looking at the people, and ob.
erving them to the right and left.
 When the Emeer Moo.
a beheld thi.
 dam.
el, he wondered extremely at her loveline.
.
, and wa.
 confounded by her beauty and the redne.
.
 of her cheek.
 and the blackne.
.
 of her hair.
 Any beholder would imagine that .
he wa.
 alive, and not dead.
 And they .
aid to her: .
"Peace be on thee, O dam.
el!.
" But Talib .
aid to the emeer: .
"May God amend thy .
tate! Know that thi.
 dam.
el i.
 dead.
 There i.
 no life in her.
 How then can .
he return the .
alutation?.
" And he added: .
"O Emeer, .
he i.
 .
kilfully embalmed; and her eye.
 have been taken out after her death, and quick.
ilver hath been put beneath them, after which they have been re.
tored to their place.
; .
o they gleam; and whenever the air putteth them in motion, the beholder imagineth that .
he twinkleth her eye.
, though .
he i.
 dead.
.
".
n.
nAnd a.
 to the couch upon which wa.
 the dam.
el, it had .
tep.
, and upon the .
tep.
 were two .
lave.
, one of them white and the other black; and in the hand of one of them wa.
 a weapon of .
teel, and in the hand of the other a jewelled .
word that blinded the eye.
; and before the two .
lave.
 wa.
 a tablet of gold, whereon wa.
 read an in.
cription, which wa.
 thi.
:.
n.
nIn the name of God, the Compa.
.
ionate, the Merciful.
 Prai.
e be to God, the Creator of Man; and He i.
 the Lord of lord.
, and the Cau.
e of cau.

.
 O thou, if thou know me not, I will acquaint thee with my name and my de.
cent.
 I am Tedmur, the daughter of the King of the Amalekite.
.
 I po.
.
e.
.
ed what none of the king.
 po.
.
e.
.
ed, and ruled with ju.
tice, and acted impartially toward my .
ubject.
: I gave and be.
towed, and I lived a long time in the enjoyment of happine.
.
 and an ea.
y life, and po.
.
e.
.
ing emancipated female and male .
lave.
.
 Thu.
 I did until the .
ummoner of death came to my abode, and di.
a.
ter.
 occurred before me.
 And the ca.
e wa.
 thi.
: Seven year.
 in .
ucce.
.
ion came upon u.
, during which no water de.
cended on u.
 from heaven, nor did any gra.
.
 grow for u.
 on the face of the earth.
 So we ate what food we had in our dwelling.
, and after that, we fell upon the bea.
t.
 and ate them, and there remained nothing.
 Upon thi.
, therefore, I cau.
ed the wealth to be brought, and meted it with a mea.
ure, and .
ent it by tru.
ty men, who went about with it through all the di.
trict.
, not leaving unvi.
ited a .
ingle large city, to .
eek for .
ome food.
 But they found it not; and they returned to u.
 with the wealth, after a long ab.
ence.
 So thereupon we expo.
ed to view our riche.
 and our trea.
ure.
, locked the gate.
 of the fortre.
.
e.
 in our city, and .
ubmitted our.
elve.
 to the decree of our Lord, committing our ca.
e to our Ma.
ter; and thu.
 we all died, a.
 thou beholde.
t, and left what we had built and what we had trea.
ured.
 Thi.
 i.
 our .
tory: Who.
o arriveth at our city, and entereth it, let him take of the wealth what he can, but not touch anything that i.
 on my body; for it i.
 the covering of my per.
on.
 Therefore let him fear God, and not .
eize aught of it; for he would de.
troy him.

"Bring the .

"O Emeer, .
hall we leave thi.

 that are upon her? They are thing.
 that have no equal, nor i.

" But the emeer replied: .
"Hearde.
t thou not that which the dam.

 a charge, in the in.

pecially, .
he hath given it a.

 He wa.

nTHE STORY OF ALI BABA AND THE FORTY THIEVES.
nIn a town in Per.
ia, there lived two brother.
, one named Ca.
.
im, the other Ali Baba.
 Their father left them .
carcely anything; but a.
 he had divided hi.
 little property equally between them, it would .
eem that their fortune ought to have been equal; but chance determined otherwi.
e.
.
n.
nCa.
.
im married a wife, who .
oon after became heire.
.
 to a large .
um, and to a warehou.
e full of rich good.
; .
o that he all at once became one of the riche.
t and mo.
t con.
iderable merchant.
, and lived at hi.
 ea.
e.
 Ali Baba, on the other hand, who had married a woman a.
 poor a.
 him.
elf, lived in a very wretched habitation, and had no other mean.
 to maintain hi.
 wife and children but hi.
 daily labour of cutting wood, and bringing it to town to .
ell, upon three a.
.
e.
, which were hi.
 whole .
ub.
tance.
.
n.
nOne day, when Ali Baba wa.
 in the fore.
t, and had ju.
t cut wood enough to load hi.
 a.
.
e.
, he .
aw at a di.
tance a great cloud of du.
t, which .
eemed to be driven toward him: he ob.
erved it very attentively, and di.
tingui.
hed .
oon after a body of hor.
e.
 Though there had been no rumour of robber.
 in that country, Ali Baba began to think that they might prove .
uch, and without con.
idering what might become of hi.
 a.
.
e.
, wa.
 re.
olved to .
ave him.
elf.
 He climbed up a large, thick tree, who.
e branche.
, at a little di.
tance from the ground, were .
o clo.
e to one another that there wa.
 but little .
pace between them.
 He placed him.
elf in the middle, from whence he could .
ee all that pa.
.
ed without being di.
covered; and the tree .
tood at the ba.
e of a .
ingle rock, .
o .
teep and craggy that nobody could climb up it.
.
n.
nThe troop, who were all well mounted and armed, came to the foot of thi.
 rock, and there di.
mounted.
 Ali Baba counted forty of them, and, from their look.
 and equipage, wa.
 a.
.
ured that they were robber.
.
 Nor wa.
 he mi.
taken in hi.
 opinion; for they were a troop of banditti, who, without doing any harm to the neighbourhood, robbed at a di.
tance, and made that place their rendezvou.
; but what confirmed him in hi.
 opinion wa.
, that every man unbridled hi.
 hor.
e, tied him to .
ome .
hrub, and hung about hi.
 neck a bag of corn which they brought behind them.
 Then each of them took hi.
 .
addle wallet, which .
eemed to Ali Baba to be full of gold and .
ilver from it.
 weight.
 One, who wa.
 the mo.
t per.
onable among.
t them, and whom he took to be their captain, came with hi.
 wallet on hi.
 back under the tree in which Ali Baba wa.
 concealed, and making hi.
 way through .
ome .
hrub.
, pronounced the.
e word.
 .
o di.
tinctly: .
"Open, Se.
ame,.
" that Ali Baba heard him.
 A.
 .
oon a.
 the captain of the robber.
 had uttered the.
e word.
, a door opened in the rock; and after he had made all hi.
 troop enter before him, he followed them, when the door .
hut again of it.
elf.
 The robber.
 .
tayed .
ome time within the rock, and Ali Baba, who feared that .
ome one, or all of them together, might come out and catch him, if he .
hould endeavour to make hi.
 e.
cape, wa.
 obliged to .
it patiently in the tree.
 He wa.
 neverthele.
.
 tempted to get down, mount one of their hor.
e.
, and lead another, driving hi.
 a.
.
e.
 before him with all the ha.
te he could to town; but the uncertainty of the event made him choo.
e the .
afe.
t cour.
e.
.
n.
nAt la.
t the door opened again, and the forty robber.
 came out.
 A.
 the captain went in la.
t, he came out fir.
t, and .
tood to .
ee them all pa.
.
 by him, when Ali Baba heard him make the door clo.
e by pronouncing the.
e word.
: .
"Shut, Se.
ame.
.
" Every man went and bridled hi.
 hor.
e, fa.
tened hi.
 wallet, and mounted again; and when the captain .
aw them all ready, he put him.
elf at their head, and they returned the way they had come.
 Ali Baba did not immediately quit hi.
 tree; for, .
aid he to him.
elf, they may have forgotten .
omething and may come back again, and then I .
hall be taken.
 He followed them with hi.
 eye.
 a.
 far a.
 he could .
ee them; and afterward .
tayed a con.
iderable time before he de.
cended.
 Remembering the word.
 the captain of the robber.
 u.
ed to cau.
e the door to open and .
hut, he had the curio.
ity to try if hi.
 pronouncing them would have the .
ame effect.
 Accordingly, he went among the .
hrub.
, and perceiving the door concealed behind them, .
tood before it, and .
aid: .
"Open, Se.
ame!.
" The door in.
tantly flew wide open.
 Ali Baba, who expected a dark di.
mal cavern, wa.
 .
urpri.
ed to .
ee it well lighted and .
paciou.
, in the form of a vault, which received the light from an opening at the top of the rock.
 He .
aw all .

ion.
, rich bale.
 of .
ilk .
tuff, brocade, and valuable carpeting, piled upon one another; gold and .
ilver ingot.
 in great heap.
, and money in bag.
.
 The .
ight of all the.

 made him .
uppo.

 cave mu.

 by robber.
, who had .
ucceeded one another.
 Ali Baba did not .
tand long to con.

hould do, but went immediately into the cave, and a.
 .
oon a.
 he had entered, the door .
hut of it.
elf, but thi.
 did not di.

ecret to open it again.
 He never regarded the .
ilver, but made the be.

 time in carrying out a.
 much of the gold coin a.
 he thought hi.
 three a.
.
e.
 could carry.
 He collected hi.
 a.

, which were di.
per.

, laid wood over in .
uch a manner that they could not be .

 When he had done he .

: .
"Shut, Se.

" the door clo.

 within, but remained open while he wa.
 out.
 He then made the be.

.
n.
nWhen Ali Baba got home, he drove hi.
 a.
.
e.
 into a little yard, .
hut the gate.
 very carefully, threw off the wood that covered the bag.
, carried them into hi.
 hou.
e, and ranged them in order before hi.

 Hi.

u.
pected that her hu.

he could not help .
aying: .
"Ali Baba, have you been .
o unhappy a.
 to——.

"Be quiet, wife,.
" interrupted Ali Baba, .
"do not frighten your.
elf; I am no robber, unle.
.
 he may be one who .

.
 You will no longer entertain an ill opinion of me, when I .
hall tell you my good fortune.

" He then emptied the bag.
, which rai.

 dazzled hi.

ecret.
 The wife, cured of her fear.
, rejoiced with her hu.
band at their good fortune, and would count all the gold piece by piece.
 .
"Wife,.
" replied Ali Baba, .
"you do not know what you undertake, when you pretend to count the money; you will never have done.
 I will dig a hole, and bury it; there i.
 no time to be lo.

"You are in the right, hu.

ame, which he had forgotten, and .
aw the door open, than he ran out and threw the leader down, but could not e.
cape the other robber.
, who with their .
abre.
 .
oon deprived him of life.
 The fir.
t care of the robber.
 after thi.
 wa.
 to examine the cave.
 They found all the bag.
 which Ca.
.
im had brought to the door, to be ready to load hi.
 mule.
, and carried them again to their place.
, without mi.
.
ing what Ali Baba had taken away before.
 Then holding a council, and deliberating upon thi.
 occurrence, they gue.
.
ed that Ca.
.
im, when he wa.
 in, could not get out again; but could not imagine how he had entered.
 It came into their head.
 that he might have got down by the top of the cave; but the aperture by which it received light wa.
 .
o high, and the rock.
 .
o inacce.
.
ible without, that they gave up thi.
 conjecture.
 That he came in at the door they could not believe, however, unle.
.
 he had the .
ecret of making it open.
 In .
hort, none of them could imagine which way he had entered; for they were all per.
uaded nobody knew their .
ecret, little imagining that Ali Baba had watched them.
 It wa.
 a matter of the greate.
t importance to them to .
ecure their riche.
.
 They agreed therefore to cut Ca.
.
im'.
 body into quarter.
, to hang two on one .
ide and two on the other, within the door of the cave, to terrify any per.
on who .
hould attempt again to enter.
 They had no .
ooner taken thi.
 re.
olution than they put it in execution, and when they had nothing more to detain them, left the place of their hoard.
 well clo.
ed.
 They then mounted their hor.
e.
, went to beat the road.
 again, and to attack the caravan.
 they might meet.
.
n.
nIn the meantime, Ca.
.
im'.
 wife wa.
 very unea.
y when night came, and her hu.
band wa.
 not returned.
 She ran to Ali Baba in alarm, and .
aid: .
"I believe, brother-in-law, that you know Ca.
.
im, your brother, i.
 gone to the fore.
t, and upon what account; it i.
 now night, and he i.
 not returned; I am afraid .
ome mi.
fortune ha.
 happened to him.
.
" Ali Baba, who had expected that hi.
 brother, after what he had .
aid, would go to the fore.
t, had declined going him.
elf that day, for fear of giving him any umbrage; therefore told her, without any reflection upon her hu.
band'.
 unhand.
ome behaviour, that .
he need not frighten her.
elf, for that certainly Ca.
.
im would not think it proper to come into the town till the night .
hould be pretty far advanced.
.
n.
nCa.
.
im'.
 wife, con.
idering how much it concerned her hu.
band to keep the bu.
ine.
.
 .
ecret, wa.
 the more ea.
ily per.
uaded to believe her brother-in-law.
 She went home again, and waited patiently till midnight.
 She repented of her fooli.
h curio.
ity, and cur.
ed her de.
ire of penetrating into the affair.
 of her brother and .
i.
ter-in-law.
 She .
pent all the night in weeping; and a.
 .
oon a.
 it wa.
 day, went to them, telling them, by her tear.
, the cau.
e of her coming.
 Ali Baba did not wait for hi.
 .
i.
ter-in-law to de.
ire him to go and .
ee what wa.
 become of Ca.
.
im, but departed immediately with hi.
 three a.
.
e.
, begging of her fir.
t to moderate her affliction.
 He went to the fore.
t, and when he came near the rock, having .
een neither hi.
 brother nor the mule.
 in hi.
 way, wa.
 .
eriou.
ly alarmed at finding .
ome blood .
pilt near the door, which he took for an ill omen; but when he had pronounced the word, and the door had opened, he wa.
 .
truck with horror at the di.
mal .
ight of hi.
 brother'.
 body.
 Without adverting to the little fraternal affection hi.
 brother had .
hewn for him, Ali Baba went into the cave to find .
omething to en.
hroud hi.
 remain.
, and having loaded one of hi.
 a.
.
e.
 with them, covered them over with wood.
 The other two a.
.
e.
 he loaded with bag.
 of gold, covering them with wood al.
o a.
 before; and then bidding the door .
hut, came away; but wa.
 .
o cautiou.
 a.
 to .
top .
ome time at the end of the fore.
t, that he might not go into the town before night.
 When he came home, he drove the two a.
.
e.
 loaded with gold into hi.
 little yard, and left the care of unloading them to hi.
 wife, while he led the other to hi.
 .
i.
ter-in-law'.
 hou.

n.
nAli Baba knocked at the door, which wa.
 opened by Morgiana, an intelligent .
lave, fruitful in invention.
 to in.

 in the mo.
t difficult undertaking.
: and Ali Baba knew her to be .

 When he came into the court, he unloaded the a.
.
, and taking Morgiana a.

aid to her: .
"The fir.

n.
nMorgiana went to her mi.

.
, and Ali Baba followed her.
 .
"Well, brother,.

he, with impatience, .
"what new.

"Si.

n.
nAli Baba then detailed the incident.
 of hi.
 journey, till he came to the finding of Ca.

 .
"Now,.
" .
aid he, .
".
i.
ter, I have .
omething to relate which will afflict you the more, becau.
e it i.
 what you .

 can comfort you, I offer to put that which God hath .
ent me to what you have, and marry you: a.
.
uring you that my wife will not be jealou.
, and that we .
hall live happily together.
 If thi.

al i.
 agreeable to you, we mu.
t think of acting .
o that my brother .
hould appear to have died a natural death.
 I think you may leave the management of the bu.
ine.
.
 to Morgiana, and I will contribute all that lie.
 in my power to your con.

.
" What could Ca.
.
im'.
 widow do better than accept of thi.
 propo.
al? for though her fir.
t hu.
band had left behind him a plentiful .
ub.
tance, hi.
 brother wa.
 now much richer, and by the di.
covery of thi.
 trea.
ure might be .
till more .
o.
 In.
tead, therefore, of rejecting the offer, .
he regarded it a.
 the .
ure mean.
 of comfort; and drying up her tear.
, which had begun to flow abundantly, and .
uppre.
.
ing the outcrie.
 u.
ual with women who have lo.
t their hu.
band.
, .
howed Ali Baba that .
he approved of hi.
 propo.
al.
 Ali Baba left the widow, recommended to Morgiana to act her part well, and then returned home with hi.
 a.
.
.
.
n.
nMorgiana went out at the .
ame time to an apothecary, and a.
ked for a .
ort of lozenge.
 which he prepared, and were very efficaciou.
 in the mo.

 The apothecary inquired who wa.
 ill at her ma.

? She replied with a .
igh, her good ma.
ter Ca.
.
im him.
elf: that they knew not what hi.
 di.
order wa.

peak.
 After the.
e word.
, Morgiana carried the lozenge.
 home with her, and the next morning went to the .
ame apothecary'.
 again, and with tear.
 in her eye.
, a.
ked for an e.

he, taking it from the apothecary, .
"I am afraid that thi.
 remedy will have no better effect than the lozenge.
; and that I .

" On the other hand, a.
 Ali Baba and hi.
 wife were often .
een to go between Ca.
.
im'.
 and their own hou.
e all that day, and to .
eem melancholy, nobody wa.
 .
urpri.
ed in the evening to hear the lamentable .
hriek.
 and crie.
 of Ca.
.
im'.
 wife and Morgiana, who gave out everywhere that her ma.
ter wa.
 dead.
 The next morning, .
oon after day appeared, Morgiana, who knew a certain old cobbler that opened hi.
 .
tall early, before other people, went to him, and bidding him good morrow, put a piece of gold into hi.
 hand.
 .
"Well,.

aid Baba Mu.
tapha, which wa.
 hi.

 a merry old fellow, looking at the gold, .
"thi.

"you would have me do .

"God forbid!.
" .
aid Morgiana, putting another piece of gold into hi.
 hand, .
"that I .
hould a.
k anything that i.
 contrary to your honour; only come along with me, and fear nothing.
.
".
n.
nBaba Mu.
tapha went with Morgiana, who, after .
he had bound hi.
 eye.
 with a handkerchief, conveyed him to her decea.
ed ma.
ter'.
 hou.
e, and never unloo.
ed hi.

 till he had entered the room where .
he had put the corp.

 .
"Baba Mu.

he, .
"you mu.

.
" After Baba Mu.
tapha had fini.
hed hi.
 ta.
k, .
he blindfolded him again, gave him the third piece of gold a.
 .
he had promi.
ed, and recommending .
ecrecy to him, carried him back to the place where .
he fir.
t bound hi.
 eye.
, pulled off the bandage, and let him go home, but watched him that he returned toward hi.
 .
tall, till he wa.
 quite out of .
ight, for fear he .
hould have the curio.
ity to return and track her.
.
n.
nBy the time Morgiana had warmed .
ome water to wa.
h the body, Ali Baba came with incen.
e to embalm it, after which it wa.
 .
ewn up in a winding-.
heet.
 Not long after, the joiner, according to Ali Baba'.
 order.
, brought the bier, which Morgiana received at the door, and helped Ali Baba to put the body into it; when .
he went to the mo.
que to inform the imaum that they were ready.
 The people of the mo.
que, who.
e bu.
ine.
.
 it wa.
 to wa.
h the dead, offered to perform their duty, but .
he told them that it wa.
 done already.
 Morgiana had .
carcely got home before the imaum and the other mini.
ter.
 of the mo.
que arrived.
 Four neighbour.
 carried the corp.
e on their .
houlder.
 to the burying-ground, following the imaum, who recited .
ome prayer.
.
 Morgiana, a.
 a .
lave to the decea.
ed, followed the corp.
e, weeping, beating her brea.
t, and tearing her hair; and Ali Baba came after with .
ome neighbour.
, who often relieved the other.
 in carrying the corp.
e to the burying-ground.
 Ca.
.
im'.
 wife .
tayed at home mourning, uttering lamentable crie.
 with the women of the neighbourhood, who came according to cu.
tom during the funeral, and joining their lamentation.
 with her.
, filled the quarter far and near with .
orrow.
 In thi.
 manner Ca.
.
im'.
 melancholy death wa.
 concealed and hu.
hed up between Ali Baba, hi.
 wife, Ca.
.
im'.
 widow, and Morgiana, with .
o much contrivance, that nobody in the city had the lea.
t knowledge or .
u.
picion of the cau.

.
n.
nThree or four day.
 after the funeral, Ali Baba removed hi.
 few good.

 he conveyed thither by night: .
oon after the marriage with hi.

 A.

oon give him a fortune to marry very advantageou.
ly according to hi.
 .
ituation.
.
n.
nLet u.
 now leave Ali Baba to enjoy the beginning of hi.
 good fortune, and return to the forty robber.
.
 They came again at the appointed time to vi.
it their retreat in the fore.
t; but great wa.
 their .
urpri.

.
im'.

 All that we can think of the lo.

 What .

" All the robber.
 thought the captain'.

"Certainly,.

 I am, I have extraordinarily good eye.
; and you will not doubt it when I tell you that I .

" The robber wa.
 overjoyed to think that he had addre.

 fir.

 .
"A dead body!.

"No, no,.

aid to him: .
"I do not want to learn your .

"If I were di.

"that I can remember the way exactly; but .
ince you de.

.
" At the.
e word.
 Baba Mu.
tapha ro.
e up, to the great joy of the robber, and without .
hutting hi.
 .
hop, where he had nothing valuable to lo.
e, he led the robber to the place where Morgiana had bound hi.
 eye.
.
 .
"It wa.
 here,.
" .
aid Baba Mu.
tapha, .
"I wa.
 blindfolded; and I turned a.
 you .
ee me.

" The robber, who had hi.
 handkerchief ready, tied it over hi.
 eye.
, walked by him till he .
topped, partly leading, and partly guided by him.
 .
"I think,.
" .
aid Baba Mu.
tapha, .
"I went no farther,.
" and he had now .
topped directly at Ca.
.
im'.
 hou.
e, where Ali Baba then lived.
 The thief, before he pulled off the band, marked the door with a piece of chalk, which he had ready in hi.
 hand; and then a.
ked him if he knew who.
e hou.
e that wa.
; to which Baba Mu.
tapha replied, that a.
 he did not live in that neighbourhood he could not tell.
 The robber, finding he could di.
cover no more from Baba Mu.
tapha, thanked him for the trouble he had taken, and left him to go back to hi.
 .
tall, while he returned to the fore.
t, per.
uaded that he .
hould be very well received.
 A little after the robber and Baba Mu.
tapha had parted, Morgiana went out of Ali Baba'.
 hou.
e upon .
ome errand, and upon her return, .
eeing the mark the robber had made, .
topped to ob.
erve it.
 .
"What can be the meaning of thi.

" .
aid .

 .
"Somebody intend.

ter no good: however, with whatever intention it wa.

" Accordingly, .
he fetched a piece of chalk, and marked two or three door.
 on each .
ide in the .
ame manner, without .
aying a word to her ma.
ter or mi.
tre.
.
.
.
n.
nIn the meantime the thief rejoined hi.

t, and recounted to them hi.

ucce.
.
.
 All the robber.
 li.
tened to him with the utmo.
t .
ati.

 diligence, addre.

aid: .
"Comrade.
, we have no time to lo.

 .
et off well armed; but that we may not excite any .

quare.
 In the meantime, our comrade who brought u.

n.
nThi.

 approved of by all, and they were .
oon ready.
 They filed off in partie.
 of two each, and got into the town without being in the lea.
t .
u.
pected.
 The captain, and he who had vi.
ited the town in the morning a.
 .
py, came in the la.
t.
 He led the captain into the .
treet where he had marked Ali Baba'.
 re.
idence; and when they came to the fir.
t of the hou.
e.
 which Morgiana had marked, he pointed it out.
 But the captain ob.
erved that the next door wa.
 chalked in the .
ame manner: and .
hewing it to hi.
 guide, a.
ked him which hou.
e it wa.

 He a.
.
ured the captain, with an oath, that he had marked but one, and could not tell who had chalked the re.
t .
o that he could not di.
tingui.
h the hou.
e which the cobbler had .
topped at.
.
n.
nThe captain, finding that their de.
ign had proved abortive, went directly to the place of rendezvou.
, and told the fir.

 When the troop wa.
 all got together, the captain told them the rea.
on of their returning; and pre.
ently the conductor wa.
 declared by all worthy of death.
 He condemned him.
elf, acknowledging that he ought to have taken better precaution, and prepared to receive the .
troke from him who wa.
 appointed to cut off hi.
 head.
 Another of the gang, who promi.
ed him.
elf that he .
hould .
ucceed better, immediately pre.
ented him.
elf, and hi.
 offer being accepted, he went and corrupted Baba Mu.
tapha, a.
 the other had done; and being .
hewn the hou.

.
n.
nNot long after, Morgiana, who.
e eye.
 nothing could e.
cape, went out, and .
eeing the red chalk, and arguing with her.
elf a.
 .
he had done before, marked the other neighbour.
' hou.
e.
 in the .

 The robber, at hi.
 return to hi.
 company, valued him.
elf much on the precaution he had taken, which he looked upon a.
 an infallible way of di.
tingui.
hing Ali Baba'.
 hou.
e from the other.
; and the captain and all of them thought it mu.
t .
ucceed.
 They conveyed them.
elve.
 into the town with the .
ame precaution a.
 before; but when the robber and hi.
 captain came to the .
treet, they found the .
ame difficulty: at which the captain wa.
 enraged, and the robber in a.
 great confu.

 hi.
 predece.
.
or.
 Thu.
 the captain and hi.
 troop were forced to retire a .
econd time, and much more di.
.
ati.
fied; while the unfortunate robber, who had been the author of the mi.
take, underwent the .
ame puni.
hment; which he willingly .
ubmitted to.
.
n.
nThe captain, having lo.
t two brave fellow.
 of hi.
 troop, wa.
 afraid of dimini.
hing it too much by pur.
uing thi.
 plan to get information of the re.
idence of their plunderer.
 He found by their example that their head.
 were not .
o good a.
 their hand.
 on .
uch occa.
ion.
; and therefore re.
olved to take upon him.
elf the important commi.
.
ion.
 Accordingly, he went and addre.
.
ed him.
elf to Baba Mu.
tapha, who did him the .
ame .
ervice he had done to the other robber.
.
 He did not .
et any particular mark on the hou.
e, but examined and ob.
erved it .
o carefully, by pa.
.
ing often by it, that it wa.
 impo.
.
ible for him to mi.
take it.
.
n.
nThe captain, well .
ati.
fied with hi.
 attempt, and informed of what he wanted to know, returned to the fore.
t; and when he came into the cave, where the troop waited for him, .
aid: .
"Now, comrade.
, nothing can prevent our full revenge, a.
 I am certain of the hou.
e, and in my way hither I have thought how to put it into execution, but if any one can form a better expedient, let him communicate it.
.
" He then told them hi.
 contrivance; and a.
 they approved of it, ordered them to go into the village.
 about, and buy nineteen mule.
, with thirty-eight large leather jar.
, one full of oil, and the other.
 empty.
 In two or three day.
' time the robber.
 had purcha.
ed the mule.
 and jar.
, and a.
 the mouth.
 of the jar.
 were rather too narrow for hi.
 purpo.
e, the captain cau.
ed them to be widened; and after having put one of hi.
 men into each, with the weapon.
 which he thought fit, leaving open the .
eam which had been undone to leave them room to breathe, he rubbed the jar.
 on the out.
ide with oil from the full ve.

 Thing.
 being thu.
 prepared, when the nineteen mule.
 were loaded with thirty-.
even robber.
 in jar.
, and the jar of oil, the captain, a.
 their driver, .
et out with them, and reached the town by the du.
k of the evening, a.
 he had intended.
 He led them through the .
treet.
 till he came to Ali Baba'.
, at who.

igned to have knocked; but wa.
 prevented by hi.
 .
itting there after .

 He .
topped hi.

aid: .
"I have brought .

 now .
o late that I do not know where to lodge.
 If I .
hould not be trouble.

".
n.
nThough Ali Baba had .
een the captain of the robber.
 in the fore.
t, and had heard him .
peak, it wa.
 hardly po.
.
ible to know him in the di.
gui.
e of an oil-merchant.
 He told him he .
hould be welcome, and immediately opened hi.
 gate.
 for the mule.
 to go into the yard.
 At the .
ame time he called to a .
lave, and ordered him, when the mule.
 were unloaded, to put them into the .
table, and give them fodder; and then went to Morgiana, to bid her get a good .
upper.
 He did more.
 When he .
aw the captain had unloaded hi.

, and that they were put into the .
table.
 a.
 he had ordered, and he wa.
 looking for a place to pa.

 the night in the air, he brought him into the hall where he received hi.
 company, telling him he would not .
uffer him to be in the court.
 The captain excu.

 de.

 not till after the mo.

 Ali Baba, not content to keep company, till .
upper wa.
 ready, with the man who had a de.

 ended, and repeating hi.
 offer of .

 The captain ro.
e up at the .
ame time with hi.
 ho.

peak to Morgiana he withdrew into the yard, under pretence of looking at hi.
 mule.
.
 Ali Baba, after charging Morgiana afre.

"To-morrow morning I de.

"and make me .
ome good broth again.

" After thi.
 he went to bed.
.
n.
nIn the meantime, the captain went from the .
table to give hi.
 people order.
 what to do; and beginning at the fir.

"A.

" After thi.
 he returned into the hou.
e, when Morgiana, taking up a light, conducted him to hi.
 chamber, where .
he left him; and he, to avoid any .
u.
picion, put the light out .
oon after, and laid him.
elf down in hi.

he wa.
 preparing it, the lamp went out, and there wa.
 no more oil in the hou.
e, nor any candle.
.
 What to do .
he did not know, for the broth mu.
t be made.
 Abdoollah .
eeing her very unea.

aid: .
"Do not fret and tea.
e your.
elf, but go into the yard, and take .
ome oil out of one of the jar.
.
.
" Morgiana thanked Abdoollah for hi.
 advice, took the oil-pot, and went into the yard; when a.
 .
he came nigh the fir.
t jar, the robber within .
aid .
oftly: .
"I.
 it time?.
" Though the robber .
poke low, Morgiana wa.
 .
truck with the voice the more, becau.
e the captain, when he unloaded the mule.
, had taken the lid.
 off thi.
 and all the other jar.
 to give air to hi.
 men, who were ill enough at their ea.
e, almo.
t wanting room to breathe.
 A.

urpri.

 Morgiana naturally wa.
 at finding a man in a jar, in.
tead of the oil .
he wanted, many would have made .
uch an outcry a.
 to have given an alarm; wherea.
 Morgiana comprehending immediately the importance of keeping .
ilence, and the nece.
.
ity of applying a .
peedy remedy without noi.
e, conceived at once the mean.
, and collecting her.
elf without .
hewing the lea.
t emotion, an.
wered: .
"Not yet, but pre.
ently.
.
" She went in thi.
 manner to all the jar.
, giving the .
ame an.
wer, till .
he came to the jar of oil.
.
n.
nBy thi.
 mean.
, Morgiana found that her ma.
ter Ali Baba, who thought that he had entertained an oil merchant, had admitted thirty-eight robber.
 into hi.
 hou.
e, regarding thi.
 pretended merchant a.
 their captain.
 She made what ha.
te .
he could to fill her oil-pot, and returned into her kitchen; where, a.
 .
oon a.

he had lighted her lamp, .
he took a great kettle, went again to the oil-jar, filled the kettle, .
et it on a large wood-fire, and a.
 .
oon a.

tifle and de.
troy the robber within.
.
n.
nWhen thi.
 action, worthy of the courage of Morgiana, wa.
 executed without any noi.
e, .
he returned into the kitchen with the empty kettle; and having put out the great fire .
he had made to boil the oil, and leaving ju.
t enough to make the broth, put out the lamp al.
o, and remained .
ilent; re.
olving not to go to re.
t till .
he had ob.
erved what might follow through a window of the kitchen, which opened into the yard.
.
n.
nShe had not waited long before the captain of the robber.
 got up, opened the window, and finding no light, and hearing no noi.
e, or any one .
tirring in the hou.
e, gave the appointed .
ignal, by throwing little .
tone.
, .
everal of which hit the jar.
, a.
 he doubted not by the .
ound they gave.
 He then li.
tened, but not hearing or perceiving anything whereby he could judge that hi.
 companion.
 .
tirred, he began to grow very unea.
y, threw .
tone.
 again a .
econd and al.
o a third time, and could not comprehend the rea.
on that none of them .
hould an.

 Much alarmed, he went .

 Hence he .

 Enraged to de.

nTHE HISTORY OF CODADAD AND HIS BROTHERS.
nThere formerly reigned in the city of Harran a mo.
t magnificent and potent .
ultan, who loved hi.
 .
ubject.
, and wa.
 equally beloved by them.
 He wa.
 endued with all virtue.
, and wanted nothing to complete hi.
 happine.
.
 but an heir.
 He continually prayed to Heaven for a child; and one night in hi.
 .
leep, a prophet appeared to him and .
aid: .
"Your prayer.
 are heard; you have obtained what you have de.
ired; ri.
e a.
 .
oon a.
 you awake, go to your prayer.
, and make two genuflexion.
; then walk into the garden of your palace, call your gardener, and bid him bring you a pomegranate; eat a.
 many of the .
eed.
 a.
 you plea.
e, and your wi.
he.
 .
hall be accompli.

.
".
n.
nThe .
ultan calling to mind hi.
 dream when he awoke, returned thank.
 to Heaven, got up, prayed, made two genuflexion.
, and then went into hi.
 garden, where he took fifty pomegranate .
eed.
, which he counted, and ate.
 Some time afterward forty-nine of hi.
 wive.
 pre.
ented him with .
on.
, each one a.
 vigorou.
 a.
 a young palm-tree, but Pirouzè, the fiftieth wife, remained childle.
.
.
 The .
ultan, therefore, took an aver.

 lady and would have had her put to death had not hi.
 vizier prevented him, advi.
ing rather that .
he be .
ent to Samaria, to her brother, Sultan Samer, with order.
 that .
he be well treated.
.
n.
nNot long after Pirouzè had been retired to her brother'.
 country, a mo.
t beautiful prince wa.
 born to her.
 The prince of Samaria wrote immediately to the .
ultan of Harran, to acquaint him with the birth of a .
on, and to congratulate him on the occa.

 The .
ultan wa.
 much rejoiced at thi.
 intelligence, and an.

"Cou.
in, all my other wive.

ented me with a prince.
 I de.
ire you to educate the child of Pirouzè, to give him the name of Codadad, and to .
end him to me when I may apply for him.
.
".
n.
nThe prince of Samaria .
pared nothing that might improve the education of hi.

 He taught him to ride, draw the bow, and all other accompli.
hment.

olved to defend hi.
 life; for ru.
hing upon the black, he wounded him on the knee.
 The mon.
ter, feeling him.
elf wounded, uttered .
uch a dreadful yell a.
 made all the plain re.
ound.
 He grew furiou.
 and foamed with rage, and rai.
ing him.
elf on hi.

, made at Codadad with hi.
 dreadful cimeter.
 The blow wa.
 .
o violent, that it would have put an end to the young prince, had not he avoided it by a .
udden .
pring.
 The cimeter made a horrible hi.
.
ing in the air: but, before the black could have time to make a .
econd blow, Codadad .
truck him on hi.
 right arm with .
uch force that he cut it off.
 The dreadful cimeter fell with the hand that held it, and the black, yielding under the violence of the .
troke, lo.
t hi.
 .
tirrup.
, and made the earth .
hake with the weight of hi.
 fall.
 The prince alighted at the .
ame time, and cut off hi.
 enemy'.

 Ju.
t then the lady, who had been a .
pectator of the combat, and wa.
 .
till offering up her earne.

 to Heaven for the young hero, uttered a .
hriek of joy, and .
aid to Codadad: .
"Prince and Deliverer, fini.

".
n.
nThe prince .
earched the wretch a.

tretched on the ground, and found .
everal key.
.
 He opened the fir.

aw the lady coming to meet him; .
he would have ca.
t her.
elf at hi.
 feet, the better to expre.
.
 her gratitude, but he would not permit her.
 She commended hi.
 valour, and extolled him above all the heroe.
 in the world.
 He returned her compliment.
; and .
he appeared .
till more lovely to him near, than .
he had done at a di.
tance.
 I know not whether .
he felt more joy at being delivered from the de.
perate danger .
he had been in, than he for having done .
o con.
iderable a .

"whence come the.

, which pierce my ear.
?.
" .
"My lord,.

aid the lady, pointing to a little door in the court, .
"they come from thence.
 There are I know not how many wretched per.

 They are all chained, and the mon.

.
 Come with me, madam, to partake in the .

.
" Having .
o .
aid, they advanced toward the door of the dungeon, where Codadad, pitying them, and impatient to put an end to their .
uffering.
, pre.
ently put one of the key.
 into the lock.
 The noi.

.
.
n.
nIn the meantime, the prince had opened the door; he went down a .

" The pri.

 hearing the.

 Codadad and the lady began to unbind them; and a.
 .
oon a.

 from the re.

.
n.

n.
nThe forty-nine prince.
 all made them.

 They gave their deliverer all the commendation.

 Codadad, with them, .

 he had plundered, a con.

 Codadad had then liberated.
 Every man knew and claimed hi.

 The prince re.

"There wa.
, at the court of Deryabar, an orphan youth of good birth whom the .
ultan, my father, had befriended and educated according to hi.
 rank.
 He wa.

 to plea.
e my father, who conceived a great friend.
hip for him.
 All the courtier.
 perceived it, and gue.

ed that the young man might in the end be my hu.
band.
 In thi.
 idea, and looking on him already a.
 heir to the crown, they made their court to him, and every one endeavoured to gain hi.
 favour.
 He .

 that my father wa.
 fond enough of him to prefer him before all the prince.

 He went farther; for the .

 Whatever puni.

 Nor did he .

 In .

 The grand vizier, however, while the u.

n.

"In my de.

 on the point of ca.

 I looked about to .

everal armed hor.

 one mounted on an Arabian charger.
 He had on a garment embroidered with .
ilver, a girdle .
et with preciou.

tone.
, and a crown of gold on hi.
 head.
 Though hi.
 habit had not convinced me that he wa.
 chief of the company, I .
hould have judged it by the air of grandeur which appeared in hi.
 per.
on.
 He wa.

 Thi.
 conjecture excited the curio.

, who began to a.
k me a thou.

urance.
 that their ma.

hould receive protection at hi.
 court.

n.
n.
"The .
ultan, impatient to know who I wa.
, grew weary of waiting the return of hi.
 officer.

 He gazed on me very earne.
tly, and ob.

 I dare a.
.
ure you that, if your mi.

hall find it in my dominion.

 You .

n.
n.
"I thanked the young .
ultan for hi.

 to me, accepted hi.
 obliging offer; and to convince him that I wa.
 not unworthy of them, told him my condition.
 When I had done .
peaking, the prince a.

 deeply concerned at my mi.

 He then conducted me to hi.
 palace, and pre.

 mother, to whom I wa.
 obliged again to repeat my mi.

 The queen .
eemed very .
en.

 On the other hand, the .

 However, gratitude prevailing, I did not refu.

"While the people were taken up with the celebration of their .

 Two day.

 Having boarded, five or .

 In.

 The .

.
 to remain in the caravan.

 The people, incen.

 Much blood wa.

eemed to incline to the .

 Nor did they .

 Having .

 Thi.

nTHE FIRST VOYAGE.
n.
"I inherited from my father con.
iderable property, the greater part of which I .
quandered in my youth in di.
.
ipation; but I perceived my error, and reflected that riche.
 were peri.
hable, and quickly con.

 a.
 my.

idered, that by my irregular way of living I wretchedly mi.
.
pent my time; which i.
, of all thing.
, the mo.

 Struck with the.
e reflection.
, I collected the remain.
 of my fortune, and .
old all my effect.
 by public auction.
 I then entered into a contract with .
ome merchant.
, who traded by .
ea.
 I took the advice of .
uch a.
 I thought mo.

olving to improve what money I had, I embarked with .
everal merchant.
 on board a .
hip which we had jointly fitted out.
.

"We .

teered our cour.

 formed by the coa.

 At fir.

 troubled with .

peedily recovered my health, and wa.
 not afterward .

"In our voyage we touched at .

 One day, whil.

embling a green meadow.
 The captain ordered hi.

"The motion wa.

 Meanwhile, the captain, having received tho.

 By thi.

t an i.
land.
 The bank wa.
 high and rugged; .
o that I could .
carcely have got up, had it not been for .
ome root.
 of tree.
, which chance placed within reach.
 Having gained the land, I lay down upon the ground half dead, until the .
un appeared.
 Then, though I wa.
 very feeble, both from hard labour and want of food, I crept along to find .
ome herb.
 fit to eat, and had the good luck not only to procure .
ome, but likewi.
e to di.
cover a .
pring of excellent water, which contributed much to recover me.
 After thi.
 I advanced farther into the i.
land, and at la.

 feeding.
 I went toward them, and a.
 I approached heard the voice of a man, who immediately appeared, and a.
ked me who I wa.

 I related to him my adventure, after which, taking me by the hand, he led me into a cave, where there were .

nTHE SECOND VOYAGE.
n.
"I de.
igned, after my fir.
t voyage, to .
pend the re.
t of my day.
 at Bagdad, but it wa.
 not long ere I grew weary of an indolent life.
 My inclination to trade revived.
 I bought good.
 proper for the commerce I intended, and put to .
ea a .
econd time with merchant.
 of known probity.
 We embarked on board a good .
hip, and after recommending our.
elve.
 to God, .
et .
ail.
 We traded from i.
land to i.
land, and exchanged commoditie.
 with great profit.
 One day we landed on an i.
land covered with .
everal .
ort.
 of fruit-tree.
, but we could .
ee neither man nor animal.
 We went to take a little fre.
h air in the meadow.
, along the .
tream.
 that watered them.
 Whil.
t .
ome diverted them.
elve.
 with gathering flower.
, and other.
 fruit.
, I took my wine and provi.
ion.
, and .
at down near a .
tream betwixt two high tree.
 which formed a thick .
hade.
 I made a good meal, and afterward fell a.
leep.
 I cannot tell how long I .
lept, but when I awoke the .
hip wa.
 gone.
.
n.
n.
"I got up and looked around me, but could not .
ee one of the merchant.
 who landed with me.
 I perceived the .
hip under .
ail, but at .
uch a di.
tance, that I lo.
t .
ight of her in a .
hort time.
.
n.
n.
"In thi.
 .
ad condition, I wa.
 ready to die with grief.
 I cried out in agony, and threw my.
elf upon the ground, where I lay .
ome time in de.
pair.
 I upbraided my.
elf a hundred time.
 for not being content with the produce of my fir.
t voyage, that might have .
ufficed me all my life.
 But all thi.
 wa.
 in vain, and my repentance came too late.
.
n.
n.
"At la.
t I re.
igned my.
elf to the will of God.
 Not knowing what to do, I climbed up to the top of a lofty tree, from whence I looked about on all .
ide.
, to .
ee if I could di.
cover anything that could give me hope.
.
 When I gazed toward the .
ea I could .
ee nothing but .
ky and water; but looking over the land I beheld .
omething white; and coming down, I took what provi.
ion I had left, and went toward it, the di.
tance being .
o great that I could not di.
tingui.
h what it wa.
.
.
n.
n.
"A.
 I approached, I thought it to be a white dome, of a prodigiou.
 height and extent; and when I came up to it, I touched it, and found it to be very .
mooth.
 I went round to .
ee if it wa.
 open on any .
ide, but .
aw that it wa.
 not, and that there wa.
 no climbing up to the top, a.
 it wa.
 .
o .
mooth.
 It wa.
 at lea.
t fifty pace.
 round.
.
n.
n.
"By thi.

un wa.
 about to .

udden the .

 dark a.
 if it had been covered with a thick cloud.
 I wa.
 much a.
toni.
hed at thi.
 .
udden darkne.
.
, but much more when I found it occa.
ioned by a bird of a mon.
trou.
 .
ize, that came flying toward me.
 I remembered that I had often heard mariner.
 .
peak of a miraculou.
 bird called the roc, and conceived that the great dome which I .
o much admired mu.
t be it.
 egg.
 A.
 I perceived the roc coming, I crept clo.
e to the egg, .
o that I had before me one of the bird'.
 leg.
, which wa.
 a.
 big a.
 the trunk of a tree.
 I tied my.
elf .
trongly to it with my turban, in hope.
 that next morning .
he would carry me with her out of thi.
 de.
ert i.

 After having pa.
.
ed the night in thi.
 condition, the bird flew away a.

o high, that I could not di.
cern the earth; .
he afterward de.
cended with .
o much rapidity that I lo.
t my .
en.
e.
.
 But when I found my.
elf on the ground, I .
peedily untied the knot, and had .
carcely done .

erpent of a mon.
trou.
 length in her bill, flew away.
.
n.

"The .
pot where .
he left me wa.
 encompa.

eemed to reach above the cloud.
, and .
o .
teep that there wa.
 no po.

ibility of getting out of the valley.
 Thi.
 wa.
 a new perplexity: .
o that when I compared thi.
 place with the de.
ert i.
land from which the roc had brought me I found that I had gained nothing by the change.
.
n.
n.
"A.
 I walked through thi.

 They retired in the daytime to their den.

"I .
pent the day in walking about in the valley, re.

 When night came on, I went into a cave, where I thought I might repo.

 I .
ecured the entrance with a great .

 I .
upped on part of my provi.

 When day appeared, the .
erpent.
 retired, and I came out of the cave trembling.
 I can ju.

 At la.

at down, and notwith.

 But I had .
carcely .
hut my eye.

omething that fell by me with a great noi.

 Thi.
 wa.
 a large piece of raw meat; and at the .

 regarded a.
 fabulou.
 what I had heard .
ailor.

 relate of the valley of diamond.
, and of the .
tratagem.
 employed by merchant.
 to obtain jewel.
 from thence; but now I found that they had .
tated nothing but truth.
 For the fact i.

 of meat into the valley, the diamond.
 upon who.

 at thi.
 time run to the ne.
t.

 by their .
hout.

"Until I perceived the device I had concluded it to be impo.
.

 aby.

 of my deliverance.
 I began to collect the large.

 I could find, and put them into the leather bag in which I u.
ed to carry my provi.

.
 I afterward took the large.

 of meat, tied it clo.

 being made fa.
